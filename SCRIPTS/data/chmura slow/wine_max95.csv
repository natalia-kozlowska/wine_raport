The Taylor family selected Clare Valley for its Cabernet affinity, but this Shiraz is a knockout. Yes, it's oaky—full of menthol, vanilla and toasted coconut—but there's just enough black cherry and plum fruit to support the wood. It's a plush, full-bodied wine with immense appeal, for drinking now–2025.
95
22
The flagship wine from Quilceda Creek offers exotic scents of plum, cassis, loam, coffee and pine sap, a rich and evocative blend. The wine delivers all that is promised and more; it is deep and dense with flavor, polished, focused and persistent. Vanilla, espresso, fine tannins, luscious acids and cascading fruits.
99
23
A stupendous Pinot Noir, showing how beautifully this vineyard performs in the remote Sonoma Coast above Fort Ross. Williams Selyem's last few vintages of Precious Mountain have been extraordinary, but this 2009 tops them all. The wine is as light as a feather in the mouth, modest in alcohol and delicately feminine, like pure satin. However, few Pinot Noirs in the world achieve this level of concentration. Wild raspberries and cherries, cola, sleek minerals, dusty baking spices and smoky oak combine for flavors that are utterly delicious. After all that, it possesses an indefinable attribute of fascination. Will age well for a long time, if you can keep your hands off it. Now–2021.
99
24
A massive wine for Margaux, packed with tannins and ripe fruit. It has more Cabernet Sauvignon than usual, giving intense black currant flavors with enticing acidity balanced by the sweetness of the fruit. Ripe swathes of this opulent fruit are also elegant and structured.
98
25
A beautiful wine, with the firmest tannins surrounded by perfumed fruit. It is dense, of course, but this density is balanced with great elegance, blackberry fruits, sweetness and final juicy acidity. The wine is structured, a powerhouse of concentration while preserving this complete style.
98
26
A stunning Pirouette—63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot, 9% Cab Franc and 6% Petit Verdot. Full and magnificently rich, it is loaded with dense and thrilling fruit flavors of black cherry and cassis. A streak of iron and a hint of citrus keep the wine evolving through a long, beautifully balanced finish. Retasted after being open for 24 hours, the wine was as fresh and thrilling as on the first day.
98
27
Here's a “wow” wine on every level, with incredible intensity and supple softness that builds momentum over many long minutes. A sweet cherry note at the core is surrounded by lush layers of tobacco, dark chocolate and spice, which promise to evolve gracefully over years to come.

97
29
Recently implemented winemaker and cellar changes make this one of the best Sassicaias ever. This Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc blend delivers thick concentration and sun-kissed aromas of black fruit, prune, dried bay leaf, black olive and tobacco. The thick, fertile soils that characterize the magical strip of coastal Tuscany at Bol-gheri help shape amazing richness and intensity.
97
30
The 2008 Ornellaia delivers concentrated aromas of forest fruit, raspberry and black cherry. There are beautiful elements of soft spice and chocolate at the back and the wine ends with soft, plush tannins and smooth, berry-rich flavors.
97
31
An outstanding wine, the best California Cabernet Jean-Charles Boisset has ever produced from any of his properties. It stands out in any tasting of its peers. Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, and aged in 60% new oak, it shows satisfying, complex flavors of blackberries, blueberries, cassis, hazelnut-infused chocolate and spices. Hard to exaggerate its power and grace. Wonderful now and for a good six years, but it's difficult to predict its evolution beyond 2018.
97
32
Such a generous and ripe wine, with a dark core of tannins surrounded by opulent fruit. Black fruits, coffee, very concentrated flavors, a powerhouse of structure and richness. The warmth of the wine is palpable, as is the aging potential.
97
33
A drop-dead gorgeous Pinot Noir that will satisfy everyone from Burgundy fans to diehard Cabernet cultists. Show an elegant complexity and silky texture that define great California Pinot Noir, yet with a powerful impact that emphasizes raspberries, cherries and blueberries. Brilliant acidity and tannins provide the perfect framework on this wine that's drinkable now, and will develop over the next 15–20 years.
97
34
A ripe year like 2009 is kind to the Cabernet Sauvignon of Château Figeac. The wine is perfumed with new wood and sweet fruits, delicious black currant flavors giving both ripeness and freshness. The wine has weight and impressive density. A star of the vintage.
96
35

96
36
Here's a beautifully chocolaty and rich blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, with plush layers of sweet cherry, Indian spice, tobacco and espresso. The wine is amazingly rich and long lasting, with silky, supple tannins at the very end. Keep it in your cellar 10 years or more, or drink it now.
96
37
Solid, very structured, packed with dense and dry tannins. There is a core of acidity and darkness that gives the wine a brooding, powerful character. At this stage, it seems austere although it does have the weight of fruit typical of the year.
96
38
A dense, immense, solidly powerful wine. The ripest fruit overflows, paralleling the dark, solid tannins. As so often, Lynch-Bages is a blockbuster, dark and concentrated, with immense aging potential.
96
39
A huge Cabernet, in the best sense of the word. It wasn't the easiest vintage, as 2007 was, but meticulous winemaking did the job, resulting in this amazingly rich, impressively ripe wine that's drinkable now and will develop for many years. The fruits veer toward blackberries, cherries and cola, and the tannins are soft and refined. One hundred percent new French oak isn't at all heavy, lending nuances of buttered toast and sweet wood tannins. Will easily age for 15 years.
96
40
The purest Cabernet Sauvignon fruit, with dark chocolate and intense dark berry flavors. The tannins are so enveloped by the fruit and yet they promise great aging. At this stage, wood shows through the fruit, but the texture is so rich and opulent that it should easily become integrated.
96
41
Beneath the surface tannins is great Merlot fruit, very ripe and full-bodied, a powerhouse of flavors. The depth and complexity of the wine is all there, along with a dark core of dryness. A wine for long-term aging.
96
42
A triumph, one of the greatest Riverblock bottings in years. This always is a captivating wine, but the '09 is particularly scrumptious. Although it's quite tannic and acidic, it's forward enough in raspberries, cherries and cola to enjoy now. But it's bone dry and as elegant as California Pinot Noir gets. The balance suggests an ability to age for a good 10 years, if not longer.
96
43
Minty new wood aromas on a wine that shows both great tannins and sweet wood. The fruit is still to show, but promises fresh plum flavors that will be delicious and juicy. This is a ripe, concentrated wine.
96
44
A sip is all it takes to fall in love with this potent Pinot Noir. Big tannins and crisp acidity make it hard to appreciate now, but there's a gigantic core of cherries and raspberries, with a firm minerality from the soil. Will develop bottle complexity over the years. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2015.
95
45
Very supple wine, with great richness and density. It is all so complete, a pleasure, powerful yet also with sweet opulent fruits layered with dark tannins. For long-term aging.
95
46
Hugely dense, foursquare wine with great fruit and the purest tannins. Chocolate and coffee predominate at the same time as sweet tannins and acidity. A wine that combines charm with great power.
95
47
One of the peculiarities of St.-Émilion's classification is that Canon la Gaffelière is not classed in the top rung. Because, as this wine shows, it produces superb wines. This is ripe while so elegant, with great intensity and sweet perfumes.
95
48
Certainly the finest Grand Ciel Syrah to date, this is a full-flavored, complete wine, loaded with pure fruit flavors of berry and cassis. The details pile on—a whiff of stone, a hint of chocolate, suggestions of spice, all in perfect proportion.
95
49
A tremendous Chardonnay. As always, the winery's '09 is bone dry, crisply acidic and minerally. You might call it austere at this point, with its tart finish of grapefruit. But a great Hanzell Chardonnay will improve for at least a decade, possible two, and this is a great Hanzell Chardonnay. The score reflects what the wine likely will be approximately eight years down the road.
95
50
Sunflower-gold in color, this heady, hedonistic Chardonnay brims with aromas of toasted brioche, lemon and herb. Bright and completely balanced, it invites sip after sip until there simply is no more. Concentrated and complex it finishes dry, lingering in beautiful layers on the tongue.
95
51
Artadi's top wine is dynamite in a bottle. Ripe, saturated, oaky aromas of blackberry, leather, blueberry pie and aged cheese are incredibly potent and alluring. This is huge in the mouth, with lemony oak and broad tannins that don't grind. Intense blackberry, coffee, toast and smoky flavors finish a mile deep, with all sorts of textural grab and character. Best from 2016 through 2026.
95
52
This structured wine opens with earthy aromas of tilled soil, underbrush, leather, cedar, bright berries and baking spices. The vibrant palate displays classic Nebbiolo flavors of crushed dark cherry, clove, cinnamon, truffle, sage, thyme and licorice alongside brisk acidity and bracing but noble tannins. It will bloom into a beauty. Drink 2020–2040.
95
53

Drink 2020–2040.
95
54
Aromas of Mediterranean herbs, hay, leather and red berry come together in this structured Barolo. Loaded with energy and intensity, it delivers creamy cherry-berry flavors layered with white pepper, clove, nutmeg and orange zest. It already has depth but needs time to develop complexity. Drink after 2022.
95
55
It offers classic Nebbiolo scents of red berry, forest floor, violet, baking spices, leather and Mediterranean herbs. The juicy palate doles out bright red cherry, mint, sage and black pepper alongside firm but velvety tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2016–2024.
95
56
Sourced from the best barrels made at the winery in 2013, this off-dry reserve checks in with roughly 30 g/L residual sugar, and plenty of acidity to more than balance it out. It's sweet, tart and sappy, with concentrated, juicy flavors of Meyer lemon, grapefruit and tangerine. It feels full-bodied and roundly fruity, then continues to extend itself with concentrated details of mineral and acid. A wine of exceptional power and length.
95
57
A wonderfully smooth, dry, complex young Cabernet, and yes, the tannins have that famous Rutherford dust. The wine is the opposite of a fruit bomb, with moderate alcohol and interesting flavors of herbs, cherries, blackberries and spicy sandalwood. As good as it is now, it should ride out the next 8–10 years.
95
58
Young and tart in cool-climate acidity, this Pinot needs time in the cellar. It's an exotic wine, spicy and peppery, almost briary, like a Zinfandel, except with flavors of wild forest raspberries, cherries, orange zest and a hint of pine cone. It's as cellarable a Pinot Noir as exists in California. Best after 2015.
95
59
Structured, concentrated, a wine that shows power from both fruit and tannins. The opulent strawberry flavors are paralleled by firm, dry tannins. As the combination comes together, this will become a glorious wine.
95
60
Consistent year after year, this blend of 67% Sauvignon Blanc and 33% Sémillon is modeled after top-flight white Bordeaux. Deep gold, toasty and scented with olive oil, walnuts and loam, it hits the palate full-on with a rainbow of flavors: citrus, stone and tropical fruits, all accented with toast, oil and nuts from barrel aging. Riveting, delicious  and unique.
95
61
95-97. Barrel sample. Showing new wood spice, this rich and full-bodied wine also has weighty fruit, with creamy and herbaceous qualities.
96
62
Structured, with years to go to take on added complexity and personality, this wine is also a study in immediate gratification, as it's presently so juicy and easy to enjoy. It comes from an east-facing block, planted to a suitcase clone. Exotic, rich red and black berry and cinnamon form an alliance of balance and mouthwatering seduction. The oak and tannin are fully in sync, while a salty, meaty finish provides additional decadence.
98
63
Alluring, ethereal scents of perfumed berry, aromatic herb, fragrant blue flower, new leather, orange zest and exotic spice abound on this radiant wine.

It's already extremely tempting but hold for even more complexity. Drink 2018–2025.
97
64
This wine is insanely good, from a dry-farmed, yes, rocky outcropping of vines planted first in 1910, then again in 1934 and the 1970s, with Carignane and Petite Sirah in the mix. It's thick, rich and beautifully put-together, full bodied and entirely balanced, with markings of cherry cordial and white pepper that seduce gently.
97
65
Dark, brooding cinnamon and fleshy black plum provide an exciting, complex counterpoint to the rakish earthiness and exotic Asian spice going on in this full-bodied, explosively compelling wine, its minerality lingering. It's young and still tightly coiled, with lingering minerality; let it open to enjoy now, but it would show best after some time, so cellar through 2024.
97
66
From a vineyard that Josh Jensen planted in 1975 comes this bottling that shows sultry black plum, minty herbs, tarragon, black slate, smashed mulberry and a touch of pork fat.

It's like an expertly cooked stew of fruit, spice and herb.
96
67
Youthfully flippant, this block of the Wayfarer Vineyard is sitting largely in sandstone, where the grapes pull remarkably revealing minerality from the soil. Racy and flinty, this medium-bodied, structured and flirty wine dances in a generosity of rich red fruit, raspberry mostly, seasoned in clove and cardamom that's fresh and incredibly seductive. Still, it'll age; drink now through 2024.
96
68
With a majority of Pommard clone in this wine contributing to its undeniable breadth and depth, this rich, rewarding wine will benefit from further time in bottle.

96
69

96
70

The spice rides a wave of body and length toward the finish, alongside an unmistakable streak of minerality. Hold through 2024.
96
71
Oh to have neighbors like these, bringing together several vineyard sites along this coveted stretch of the appellation.

96
74
The producer's Russian River Valley fruit comes from the Winside Vineyard, planted long ago by Anne Moller-Racke and Joe Nugent. It astounds in this must-have wine, complex and ridiculously velvety in texture. Pepper, clove and cardamom ride huge waves of baked fruit and mocha, with the structure to age through at least 2026, but why wait when it's so delicious now?
95
75
95   Massolino 2012 Parafada (Barolo). A textbook Barolo, this opens with scents of mature berry, leather, underbrush, tobacco and an elegant trace of fragrant blue flower.

95
76
This voluptuously seductive wine is also elegantly balanced. Citrus, wet stone and sea salt lift the minerality to pronounced levels, accented by a crispness of lemon peel and papaya wrapped in blossoming jasmine. Many of the vines on the site date back nearly 40 years, a demonstration that in age there is beauty.
95
77
Bruised strawberries and ripe red plums are leveled by iron, ginger snaps, crushed slate and soy on the umami-laden nose of this bottling by Winemaker Jonathan Nagy.

95
79

95
81
This is a beautiful display of Durell's greatness, crafted from two blocks of the vineyard, one planted to Old Wente, the other in one of the site's most rocky and windy areas. Combined, it offers well-integrated notions of golden apple, pear and honey amidst a freshness of acidity and unobtrusive oak, just the slightest suggestion of nutmeg-dusted brioche on the finish.
95
82

The light yet grippy texture is stunning.
95

95
93
This beautiful wine is austere at this very young stage. But what pent-up power—the richness comes from glorious ripe fruit, tempered with a core of steel and wrapped with pure lemon, apricot and toast flavors. Age for 10 years at least.
97

95
97

95
98

It's a wine to enjoy from a giant leather chaise, if possible. Cellar until 2023.
95
126
The estate is owned by the Olazabal family, descendants of Antonia Ferreira who created this and many other estates in the 19th century.

This wine, with its massive tannins and rich fruit, is obviously set for a long life. It does have the contrast of fresh black-currant acidity to give it a lift. But with the power behind it, the wine will develop slowly. Drink from 2025.

136
Black in the glass and dense with aromas of cooked blueberry, vanilla, maple syrup, brown sugar, tar, fudge and fresh purple flowers, this wine takes ripeness and concentration to impressive heights. Lavish on the palate with sticky, grippy tannins, the flavors of blueberry fudge, cola, black pepper and lavender are bold and delicious.
95
137
This is rich, while also such a stylish wine. It is ripe and full of tannins while masking that firm structure with immensely generous fruit. The two give the wine power, density and elegance. Drink this impressive wine from 2025.
95
138
This is a stellar wine. Dusty citrus spiked with clove comes to mind first aromatically and continues through to the palate. Tart acidity supports sublime texture and a lightness that never means lean. Red currant, grapefruit and orange provide additional lift and focus.
95
139
Dulcet peach, apricot and citrus sweetness extends languorously from nose to finish in this powerfully ripe, hedonistic wine. It's dancing and delicate in frame, yet unctuously juicy, filling the mouth with a blanket of luminous fruit. Sprightly tangerine acidity and delicate tea-leaf tannins lend structure to a long, penetrating finish. It's irresistible already but should continue to drink well for decades.
95
140
Sourced largely from the Martin Stelling Vineyard behind the winery in the western shade of Oakville, this wine opens with charred oak and a smoky, meaty character that intrigues. Seamless on the palate in soft, perceptible tannin, it delves into characteristics of cedar and brushy sage as it goes, unveiling a wildness that's hard to contain. Its bright, fresh finish gives it a roundness that's ready to enjoy now.
95
141
Bringing together multiple sites in one wine, this provides a fine example of the sum equalling more than the parts. Well balanced and crafted, it offers aromas of sandalwood and smoked meat that contrast with more exuberant, textured layers of black cherry and citrus peel.
95
142
Plump yet bright with fruit, suave yet spicy with herbs and gamy elements, this bottling shows candied cherry and cranberry alongside sage, eucalyptus and slight barnyard notes. The same juicy red fruit immediately elevates the palate, which is then leveled by lively Mediterranean spice and a buoyant acidity.
95
143
This winery's bottlings manage to pack bright, fruity energy and a wide array of herbs and seasonings into the same lithe frame. In this case, sagebrush and chaparral meet candied red cherry and dark pomegranate on the nose. The palate shows lots of oregano, thyme and bay leaf against a ripe cranberry base, with touches of black tea and rosehip adding to the complexity.
95
144
The mountain appellation speaks loudly in this wine, contributing juicy blackberry, tar and leather, all within a forested context of wild truffle and crunchy leaves. Concentrated and robust in body and ripeness, it unwinds slowly in the glass, imparting jolts of black pepper as it goes.
95
145
Always impressive, this wine is structured and powerful, with firm tannins that are still coming together. Packed with black fruits and tannins, it conveys a rich, almost Port-like quality, perhaps because the grapes are foot-trodden as in Port. Drink this wine from 2022.
95
146
Site speaks loudly in this beautifully made wine that is allowed to show its naturally inclined power within a constraint of cool-climate terroir. Juicy and explosive on the palate in cherry, raspberry, forest floor and jolts of cardamom, it's both lush and toasty, with a firmness to the tannin structure that suggests plenty of aging potential. It should get pretty interesting between 2024 and 2034, if one can possibly wait.
95
147
Combining finesse and structure, this impressive wine opens with fantastic scents of new leather, woodland berry, baking spice and balsamic notes. A blend of Nebbiolo and 15% Vespolina, the enticing palate doles out juicy black cherry, raspberry and white pepper framed in firm refined tannins. An energizing mineral note carries the lingering finish. Despite the warm vintage, it still boasts freshness. Drink through 2026.
95
148
Softly layered, this ripe, bold wine shows a wealth of body and complexity. The ripeness will please for its interwoven notions of Dr Pepper, black-cherry jam and black pepper, its tannins leathery and full of bravado.
95
149
There is impressive depth to the nose of this bottling, with concentrated black cherry, black plum and blueberry fruit enhanced by white pepper, roasted meat, licorice and hot asphalt. The palate is awash in savory flavors, with soy, charred beef and tobacco followed by waves of blueberry and leather and a wash of vanilla, plum skin and mocha, all atop perfectly polished tannins.
95
150
This wine is made to highlight the vintage and best vineyards, relying heavily on the producer's top-end site, Sacrashe. A hugely constructed wine, bold and brawny, it also manages to be soft and velvety, allowing for a greater contribution of savory elements than sweet, from leather to black pepper to Mexican chocolate. It pushes the boundaries on decadence in mysterious ways.
95
151
The producer held this wine back from release because it came from such a great ageworthy vintage—this is well worth the weight. With the wonderful richness of the 75% Pinot Noir dominating, this is a balanced wine, just hinting at toastiness, with concentrated ripe apple fruits melding into the texture of the wine.
96
152
The fascinating nose of this wine is reason enough to seek it out—an aromatic display of underripe raspberry, tart pomegranate, fresh dill, eucalyptus and sage. Montmorency cherry notes show on the palate, along with mace, Vietnamese cinnamon and fennel. A unique, refreshing and memorable wine.
96
153
Deliciously heady notes of peach and chamomile immediately hit the nose, promising ripeness and aromatic riches. The palate does not disappoint, releasing even more of those wonderfully balm-like, aromatic flavors. It brightens them with wondrous lemon freshness and boosts them with a poised dose of residual sweetness. It's an unusual wine that does not really fit any category but sits in a delicious aromatic off-dry class of its own. The best option with this probably is cheese, but it will serve well as a philosopher's wine, savored on its own. It has enough depth and beauty to nourish sustained thought. Drink 2018–2035.
96
154
Right now this is still shy on the nose. There is a glint of pear peel and Mirabelle, plus a suggestion of smoke. The palate is equally shy as the principal sensation is that of wonderfully tangy texture, fresh concentrated acidity and balanced sweetness right now. This needs time to develop its undoubtedly rich flavors. The balance is impeccable. Immense power and lasting strength lie at the core of this monumental wine. This is made to last and should be given time in the cellar. Drink 2025–2050.
96
155
A touch of lemon balm adds a breezy freshness to the nose, while a pure, bright and precise notion of ripe lemon pervades and takes over the entire palate. On its fringes, delicious hints of chamomile and chervil appear alongside ripe red apple. This is a tantalizing charmer in spite of its absolute dryness and vivid acidity. Drink 2017–2037.
96
156
The nose is still closed but already gives glimpses of citrus zestiness. The palate is a riot of both fresh and candied peel, think Seville orange, tangerine and Meyer lemon. The zesty freshness of the citrus fruit always has the upper hand on this energetic, exuberant late harvest wine and counters the residual sweetness perfectly. Killer acidity and utter concentration create a magnetic, delicious, age-worthy wine. The finish is off dry and refreshing, with a sweetish glint here and there. Drink 2017–2040 at least.
96
157
Glorious and utterly enticing notes of peach hover on the nose. They are joined by a tart, aromatic citrus tang of bergamot and citrus foliage. The palate has that same alluring aromatic spectrum that unites utter freshness with exoticism. This seems light but also packs an incredible punch. There is energy and verve on the midpalate, which has an utterly compact, concentrated but fluid texture. Bright zestiness illuminates the entire palate. It's a most unusual and most beguiling Riesling with incredible appeal and potential. Drink 2017–2040.
96
158
There is a glorious touch of ripe peach among the abundant lemon notes of the nose. A hint of grapefruit spice lends added allure. These notes carry to the palate that is juicy in ripe peach, grapefruit and bright lemon. All this happens on an completely dry, finely delineated body of absolute precision and poise. There is something crystalline about this, something fine-boned and delicate that nonetheless has absolute power to convince. This is simply wonderful. Its inherent grace will only increase with time. Drink 2020–2037.
96
159
Smoke and the merest, tantalizing whiff of toffee apple can be discerned on the nose. Fragrant herbs—think chervil and yarrow—also make an appearance. The palate is dry but brims with ripe lemon oil and fresh lemon fruit. This is streamlined and impactful, with a commanding, overarching freshness that only enforces the inherent power of this site more. For now this is tightly wound and still closed, majoring on its ample lemon charm but this needs bottle age to let the myriad notes promised on the nose unfold on the palate. Drink 2022–2040.
96
160
Earth, smoke and lifted lemon peel create a very alluring, almost primal aroma. The palate comes in with gentle, subdued sweetness, boosting ripe pear notes before revealing fir honey bitterness and tangy grapefruit zest. A warm sandalwood-spiced core is still tightly closed, holding further stores of fruit and spice and signalling lasting power and barely tamed energy. While aromas are enticing now this deserves cellaring to come into its own. There is much drive and a dynamic citrus freshness wills you to sip more. This draws you in dangerously. The finish is dry and totally enticing. Drink 2020–2040.
96
161
Chamomile and ripe, red-apple notes make for an appetizing nose. The palate adds lovely vivid notes of zesty tangerine to this. Aromas of hay flowers also appear on this shimmering, aromatic, tight, taut and linear Riesling. Concentration fills the mouth with wonderfully light but sure-footed brightness and flavor. The dry long finish has a grounding earthy touch. Simply wonderful. Drink 2017–2035.
95
162
This beautiful wine, with its poise, elegance and balance, has both a steely mineral core and an outer ripe-fruit character. It has citrus, tight acidity and rich apple and green-plum flavors. The wine is still a little young and will be better from 2019.
95
163
Touches of vanilla, cream and lovely hints of oatmeal allude to developing, evolving autolytic notes. These are edged with pure lemon, giving equal expression to emollience and freshness. On the midpalate the creamy, generous richness of yeast comes through, providing stucture and a canvas against which tart apple and Amalfi lemon can play. Depth and serious intent shows amid the sensuously fine fizz. Although this wine is refreshing and bright now, more bottle age will make it even more alluring. The pure and lasting finish leaves you wanting more. Drink 2017–2017.
95
164
Extremely dark in color and nearly opaque, this bottling shows dried violet, lilac and lavender scents, along with a charred black currant essence that's rich but not sweet. Prominent acidity and soft but structured tannins present roasted black fruit and baking spice flavors. Drink 2019–2030.
95
165
Perfectly baked red cherry aromas are dusted with cola, slate, olive, sumac and Middle Eastern spice on the nose of this bottling from the historic vineyard. The palate expertly balances tight tannins, bright acidity and a vibrant energy to deliver tart raspberry, thyme, forest floor and roast beef flavors that sail into the zingy finish.
95
166
Only 95 cases were made of this Bordeaux-style blend of 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Malbec and 24% Cabernet Franc. It's a stellar example of the high-end and highly cellarable wines that can come out of South Africa, oozing with depth, concentration and complexity, all in a harmonious, balanced package. It's dark and brooding right off the bat, boasting firm, tight blackberry, cherry and cassis fruit that's coupled with hints of raspberry sauce, pressed violets and baking spice. The palate is strong and packed with black fruit flavors that lead into a long, evolving finish of char, espresso bean, cigar and woodspice. Firmly structured and robust in feel, try from 2022–2028, though it could mature well even beyond.
95
167
A floral touch of honeysuckle plays spicily on the nose alongside aromatic Williams pear. The palate adds a sonorous and pleasant bitterness to this, reminiscent of fir honey, while the floral overtones of honeysuckle shimmer everywhere. There is quite some warmth and energy in this wine, smouldering at the very core. This is lovely now but is sure to last with all its brooding power. The finish is long and dry and returns to that pure note of Williams pear. Drink 2017–2035.
95
168
A tender notion of slightly bitter, dark fir honey appears first before a touch of smoke and ripe peach come in. The off-dry palate uses its sweetness to underline the rich peachy fruit that also has a touch of golden mirabelle. The big bold palate is concentrated and energetic, pervaded by a streak of zesty lemon freshness that keeps this from becoming too rich. There is undeniable drive here, and a very lasting persistent length of peach and lemon flavors which will develop much more with bottle age. Drink. 2017–2037.
95
169
A flinty touch of promising reduction still hovers on the nose but cheeky floral and fruity hints of honeysuckle, jasmine and peach shimmer through. The palate unites all of these aromatic notions on a textured, layered and concentrated palate. The hints of honeysuckle spice are intensified by the ripe zestiness of Amalfi lemon and tangerine. The finish is dry and long, with ample refreshment from these gorgeous citrus notes. This is glorious now in its youthful exuberance but has the concentration, structure and fruit to age beautifully. Drink 2017–2035.
95
170
Aged in a combination of concrete egg, stainless steel and new French oak, this winning white is a study in peach and apricot—it's incredibly inviting in both taste and aroma. A layer of honey adds succulence without sweetness, as it remains dry and balanced through the mineral-laden finish.
95
171
Tender notes of orange peel and pear skin reach the nose. The palate shows a vivid note of orange peel, with an herbal hint of mint and a wonderfully light, fluid touch. There is concentration but also poise, absolute dryness and wonderful length. There is an elegant touch that makes this all the more seductive, especially on the tingling zesty finish. A total joy. Drink 2017–2030.
95
172
The nose opens with a concentrated hit of ripe clementine peel, underneath this notions of mirabelle and pear shimmer. The palate is concentrated and full but appears much lighter—a combination of fresh acidity and an alluring touch of residual sweetness do their best to add a spring to the step of this unusual but captivating wine. Scintillating hints of mandarin peel, honeysuckle and kumquat make this incredibly moreish. The finish is off dry to medium sweet. Lovely now, but it's sure to last. Try with cheeses or spicy Asian dishes. Drink 2017–2027.
95
173
A wonderfully aromatic nose presents orange blossom and tangerine zest, Seville orange and ripe mandarin. All of these notions are joyously bundled on the concentrated dry palate that is brightened with even more zesty lemon freshness. There is drive here and an arrow-like structure that is energetic and totally refreshing. Uncompromising freshness, expressed with exuberant citrus charm, enlivens everything. The absolutely dry finish is invigorating and lasting. Drink 2018–2035.
95
174
Now just approaching maturity, this floral, aromatic wine is superb. Very dry, very crisp and with delicious lemon and green-apple freshness, the wine also has a strongly mineral character that comes from the chalk soil of the Côte des Blancs. The wine is just ready, although it will age further.
95
175
From a meticulously farmed site, this robust wine is intense and powerful, with a baked fruit component that makes it compelling and delicious. Forest floor, sage and rhubarb jam notes enwrap its concentrated weight and texture, with an underlying acidity that tingles the tongue.
95
176
This is a velvety smooth, superbly made white with delightful sparks of fresh-squeezed lemon, stone and salt. Ginger and lemongrass touches add an exotic quality, enhancing its bright freshness and core of acid-led tension.
95
177
Just beginning to mature, this balanced, ripe wine is complex, with bright acidity, toast and pear and green-plum fruits. It is rich, with a tight mouse that shows intensity as well as a stylish character. This is a fine wine just coming into its own but well worth aging further until 2020.
95
178
Wild strawberry and plum mix with subtle yet sultry notes of nutmeg, mace, loam, graphite and game on the nose of this bottling. Sizzling acidity leads the palate, carrying cherry, plum and red apple flavors, followed by layers of eucalyptus and pine forest.
95
179
This wine comes alive on the expansive, fleshy palate of black pepper and olive tapenade flavors. It walks a fine line between tenacious structure and high-cheekboned fruit—a mélange of raspberry, cassis and blueberry compote. The aromas are enticing and reminiscent of violets. Though it can be enjoyed now, it will evolve well through 2034.
95
180
What a heady nose. Tangerine peel, hay flowers and ripe apples all dance and swirl across the senses. The palate takes the swirling fruit and fragrance up a notch, heightened with the intensity of tangy lemon freshness. This has utter precision and concentration, there almost seems to be a life force of stone and power behind it. It's a textbook Riesling with a clean, dry and totally tangy moreish finish. Lovely now but with great potential. Drink 2017–2035.
95
181
Fruit was picked later than normal and the Masseto Merlot does indeed show mature aromas of black cherry, ripe blackberry, earthy iron and polished stone. The intensity and purity are amazing and the wine is sophisticated, soft and very rich on the finish. It is already showing beautiful evolution in the glass.
95
182
An awesome Chardonnay that gives everything you want in richness, yet frames it in a structural integrity rare in California. Dazzles with tropical fruit, green apple and pear flavors, with a brilliant overlay of oak that adds buttered toast and spice flavors, not to mention sturdy oak tannins. But it's the zesty acidity, like a squirt of lime juice, that really elevates this wine.
95
183
This wine is still young and precocious, but don't judge it too quickly. Let it air in your glass, and watch how it changes. One minute it's all cherries and smoke; the next it heaves up a great draught of currants, cocoa and cedar. It's a big wine but deceptive; the tannins are airy and lilting, there's charm and underneath, enormous complexity. It's best left alone for a few more years, but it's really very lovely now.
95
184
Here's a gorgeous, delicious wine that's all about sheer elegance. It's loaded with alluring blue flower, creamy wild cherry and black raspberry sensations accented by notes of carob, clove and white pepper. This is impeccably balanced, with fresh acidity, silky, smooth tannins and a long, lingering finish. It already boasts great depth and complexity, but will continue to evolve for years.
95
185
Hailing from a warm region and a warm vintage, this is displaying maximum ripeness on the nose via raisin, prune, blackberry and fig aromas. In the mouth, this is loamy, chewy, a mile deep and rich as Bill Gates. Concentrated black cherry, blackberry, cassis, chocolate and mocha flavors conclude with baked notes, licorice and tobacco. So smooth, yet bullish. Drink through 2022.
95
186
Aromas of spiced berry, coffee and balsam wood start slow and pick up intensity. This is powerful but focused from front to back, with hard but honest tannins that will soften with time. Pure, potent flavors of cherry, berry and chocolate come with tons of spicy, peppery oak and all sorts of textural depth. Drink from 2015–2028.
95
187
A small, acre-sized parcel gives a wine that has both great structure and finesse. It retains the natural fruitiness of the vintage as well as a more defined texture. Concentration and densely ripe fruit are already finely integrated with the hints of wood. The wine speaks of long aging potential; don't drink before 2019.
95
188
Rounded and rich, it is full of dark fruits and red cherries that combine with firm tannins and great acidity. This comes from a parcel of the Corton Rognets Grand Cru that unusually has been given the Faiveley name. Drink from 2020.
95
189
This dark, brooding wine is still tight and closed. It's powerful and concentrated, with gripping tannins as well as delicious black fruits. It's solid, chunky and very firm while retaining the generous fruitiness of the vintage. Don't drink before 2020.
95
190
Va Piano has introduced a stellar series of single-vineyard Syrahs. But if you had to pick just one, it would have to be this massive, beautifully structured bottle from Les Collines vineyard. Concentrated boysenberry fruit leads into a firm, sleek, subtle wine with even deeper flavors of black cherry, chocolate, espresso and baking spices.
95
191
From vines owned by the Chanson family, this is a wonderfully rich wine, deliciously fruity at the same time. Apple and citrus as well as richer apricots come through powerfully. It's structured with a sense of opulence, richness that also has a tight texture. It needs to age; drink from 2019.
95
192
This is richly powerful, packed with dark plum fruits and solid, concentrated tannins. At this stage, it is closed, a potential powerhouse of firm fruits and structure. It has weight, the fruit and the firm texture all promising long-term aging. Drink from 2020.
95
193
This special wine begins with stunning aromas of cedar, roasted meat and ripe raspberries, then adds savory notes of espresso and black olives to create a harmonious blend of fruity and savory elements. It's full bodied yet supple, with a long, fruit-filled finish. Already enjoyable, it should age well for at least 10 years.
95
194
Remarkably inky in color for a Grenache-based blend, it features strong aromas of cedar, meat and deeply purple fruit. The soft, rich mouthfeel coats the palate like a luxurious lacquer, and features flavors of blackberry jam, macerated cherry and vanilla-spiced plums. The blend of florals, herbals, fruit and oak-driven tannins is masterful. Drink now by itself or with a peppercorn-crusted filet mignon.
95
195
This is the big one, one of the most treasured white wine vineyards in the world. And the wine is magnificent, balanced with restrained power and style. Yellow fruits are shot through with acidity that conveys a nervy texture and an intense, concentrated character. This needs many years; don't drink before 2020.
95
196
Power and concentration exude from this wine. Very structured, very firm, it has solid tannins backed up by powerful black, juicy fruits. Blackberry flavors are still developing in this seriously ageworthy wine. Drink from 2020.
95
197
What a fine, beautiful wine this is. Shows every graceful aspect of a modern Napa Cab, from the perfectly ripened fruit to the unbelievably fine tannins and application of oak. Thrills the mouth with decadently rich black currants, crême de cassis, milk chocolate, anise and cedar flavors, but never loses an impeccable sense of balance and control. Best now, even without decanting, and through 2014.
96
198
Stature is always a Bordeaux blend, but varies in vineyard source each year. This '04 is soft, utterly delicious and fully drinkable now. It's rich in black currant, cherry pie filling, plum, anise and spice flavors, generously aged in smoky new oak. Made in the modern style, it will hold effortlessly through 2012, at least.
96
199
Made from 98% Cabernet Sauvignon, with no Merlot or Cabernet Franc for the first time, the '05 Rubicon tastes bigger and more impenetrable than any previous vintage. It's thick and heavy at this time, with furry tannins and undeniably ripe flavors of blackberries, black currants, cherries, violets, chocolate and cedar, and a tang of melted minerals. Desperately needs time in the cellar. Nowhere near ready for at least four years, and that may be conservative. Tasted three times, and better each time, a seriously good sign, and potentially a perfect wine.
96
200
Here's an important new Cabernet that instantly takes 
217
Fairly light in color and body, this wine sings in fresh cranberry and orange before revealing a meatier underbelly of black tea and sautéed mushroom. Finessed and vibrant in minerality, it has pretty rose and fresh-picked cherry characters that dance on the palate as it evolves and unravels provocatively in the glass.
95
218
A structured, concentrated and classically crafted 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. Sanguine red currant and rhubarb combine with darker, more brooding tangles of blackberry and clove to define this beauty, enhanced by a velvety texture and lingering accents of cedar, pine and dried herb.
95
219
The home vineyard of Madiran's star, Alain Brumont, has yielded a superb wine that is full of dark tannins and with a considerable ability to age. It is balanced, concentrated and touched by spice and toastiness from the wood aging. In tandem with that are generous fruits within a dense structure that is just beginning to smooth out. Drink from 2018–2038.
95
220
The producer's larger-production offering, this in no way suffers from not having a vineyard designated. Instead, it shows the prowess of blending, delivering a big, bold style with elegance and grace. Tangy cranberry and orange rind wrap themselves around powerful acidity and a silky body, finishing with notes of earth and cardamom.
95
221
It's amazing how rich this is, given the pale, translucent ruby color. Waves of cherries, raspberries, roasted hazelnuts, cola, pomegranates, herb tea, dusty Asian spices and smoky oak change constantly in the glass, as the wine breathes and endlessly fascinates. Bone-dry and tartly crisp, the wine will develop bottle complexities over the next eight years.
95
222
An intriguing, fabulous dessert wine. The aromas are complex, intense and balanced on a tightrope: mature peach, honey, wet stone, peppermint and delicate mineral nuances. Picolit is an indigenous grape that suffers from a unique disorder in which a good number of berries on each cluster never mature. The remaining berries become concentrated in rich flavor and sugar. Livio Felluga's version is a masterpiece that ends with a fresh, menthol-driven finish and a crisp close. Pair this elegant wine with crème brûlée or a light caramel custard.
95
223
Strong's Symmetry almost qualifies as a Cabernet Sauvignon, with 71% of that variety, and the rest consisting of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. The Meritage labeling identifies it as their supreme bottling of a Bordeaux-style wine. Easily the best Symmetry ever, it is a great wine. Dry and somewhat astringent in tannins, it has an impressively deep core of blackberries and currants, with an array of sweet herbs, chocolate and tobacco. It's delicious now, and should slowly develop bottle complexities over the next 10 years.
95
224
Hat Trick is the best of the best of Morgan's estate vineyard, which is in the chilliest northwestern part of the Highlands. Acidity stars, giving the wine a brilliant crispness that's so clean and fine. Barrel fermented in one-third new French oak, the wine is incredibly rich and leesy. The terroir has coaxed out complex layers of pineapples, Meyer lemons, limes, apricots and very exotic tropical fruits suggesting golden mangoes and papayas. The oak adds even richer layers of crème brûlée to this vastly enjoyable wine.
95
225
Blossomy pink-grapefruit perfume bursts from this fruity, floral, complex auslese. While lip-smackingly sweet with flavors of red berries and hibiscus nectar, it's grounded with a backdrop of acidity and steely minerality that resonates long through the finish.
95
226
Sheer in texture, this honeyed nectar falls on the palate like a whisper, but its stone fruit, red berry and grapefruit flavors are powerful and compounding. Multifaceted with touches of sugar cookie and guava juxtaposed with lime zest and slate, it delivers a long, ponderous finish.
95
227
This top wine from Quinta Vale Dona Maria comes from a small parcel of old vines on the estate close to the river Torto. Foot treading in lagars give the wine its richness and sumptuous character. It also provides tannins that are cushioned by the superripe black fruits and acidity. This long-term wine shouldn't be touched until 2020.
95
228
From the vineyard that helped propel the appellation's reputation into the stratosphere, this wine delivers both in terms of its historical significance, but also in present-day refinement and complexity. A flinty, earthy layer of black truffle and coffee open the aromatic profile of the wine before offering bold, brawny flavors of leather and black currant. The oak is well integrated and the tannins sizable yet behaved. This is a beautiful wine.
95
229
The original vineyard owned by winemaking husband and wife Jorge Borges and Sandra Tavares da Silva, this is halfway up the Pinhão Valley, close to some of the greatest Douro vineyards. Pintas is now well established as a Douro classic. It is powered by tannins at this stage, but the structure, the lush fruit that comes from fermentation in open lagars and the sheer density of the wine, speak of greatness. Drink from 2019.
95
230
Made from vines planted over a century ago and fermented in open lagars, this is a powerful and magnificent wine. With great tannins forming the base for opulent fruits black fruits and a serious structure, it should age for many years. Drink from 2020.
95
231
Balancing power and grace, this wine delivers alluring aromas and flavors of ripe black cherry, raspberry compote, grilled herb, licorice and tar. Vibrant acidity and firm, velvety tannins provide freshness and structure, while a hint of pipe tobacco closes the lingering finish. Drink 2020–2032.
97
232
Marked by both reduction and oak, this wine feels lifted with acidity, opening in a vibrant shock of strawberry and Mandarin orange. Velvety layers subtle tannin carry a spicy finish of clove and salty sea air. A beautifully balanced, complete wine.
97
233
With 83% Sémillon in the blend, this wine has weight as well as richness. At the same time, it has a crisp edge, a smoky character from wood aging and the fine balance between citrus and more exotic fruits. It is a wine to age for many years. Drink from 2022.
97
234
This is a major wine. It has enormous tension, structure and a core of dark tannins. Amid all this, the wine is also packed with fruit and concentrated blackberry and black-plum flavors. It will age slowly and steadily with its enormous structure and concentration. Drink this wine from 2027.
97
235
Effectively half-and-half Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is a tremendous wine. With very fine tannins, spice from a touch of wood and swathes of ripe fruits give this wine its concentration and its huge potential. The wine has weight and a dark, dense structure that will allow it to age for many years. Drink from 2027.
97
236
With seriously dense tannins, this shows great structure. Rich and full of ripe fruit, it also has a fresh streak that gives it a lift. The structure will allow the wine to age over many years while the fruit and acidity will give it crispness. Drink this impressive wine from 2027.
97

The tightly closed nose only gives away a little ripe red apple. Even with the fruit locked underneath the stones, the sleek power, the impression of saltiness and lime-zest purity of this wine whisper promises. These will be kept, at least if you wait until 2017. This one will last and last.
95
310
Black berry, plum, red currant and cedar aromas take center stage in this fantastic vintage of one of Italy's most iconic wines. The structured, poised palate delivers a great depth of flavors that include succulent black cherry, cracked black pepper and mocha that are energized by a flinty mineral note. Smooth and balanced with polished tannins and fresh acidity, this is already delicious but hold for complexity. Drink 2015–2030.
95
311
This wine has so many of the structural elements of a Saint-Estèphe, but also is enveloped by ripe fruitiness. Black in color and dense in character, it has sweetness from the plum juice fruits and great acidity. But it is also firm, powerfully projecting a serious potential. Drink from 2022.
95
312
There is a lightness about this vintage of Mouton Rothschild. It doesn't take away from its quality but does give the wine poise and an attractive lift. The wine is based on solid tannins, then the ripe fruit builds layers of fruitiness and freshness. It is not likely to be one of the longest-aging Moutons, but it will be delicious. Drink from 2020.
95
313
Powdery notions of white peony petals against a stony background suggest concealed aromas that need time to come to the fore. Right now the palate is tight, with buffered acidity at the core, long, lean and promising. Lime zest lurks amid suspicions of ripe peaches in a sherbety, lemony sharpness. The wine will blossom as of 2017.
95
314
In comparison with the 2008 Cabernet, this is the bigger wine, less sleek, more chewy. As it opens in the glass, the aromas display incense scents, and there is assertive, blocky, chewy fruit––especially black cherry. The tannins are also bigger, blockier, more substantial than the Cabernet. With hours of breathing time, exotic spices (saffron and more) emerge.
96
315
Gilles Nicault, who oversees the Long Shadows portfolio, makes this pure Cabernet. If this had a Napa Valley label on it, it could sell for three times the price. The structure is full and fleshy, but with the vividly bright fruit that screams Washington State. Juicy acidity underscores the berries, cherries and plums; the generously applied new oak adds texture and layers of caramel, coconut and chocolate. A bottle that belongs with Washington's (and California's) best.
96
316
Very opulent, very rich, this is a complex, structured wine packed with fruit and brooding tannins. It is already rich, and will develop into a beautifully intense, concentrated and generous wine.
96
317
A sumptuous wine, rich in bright red fruits, with a structure and depth of flavor to match. The wine is gorgeously ripe, opening its heart quickly. Acidity, bitter chocolate and dark cherries go with the tannic core to promise long aging.
96
318
This is an exceptional wine that will leave a mark, and a memory, with those who drink it. It's irresistible because of its brilliant, but simple, philosophy. Traditional Nebbiolo tones of cola, licorice and pressed violets are set beautifully against modern tones of spice, chocolate and vanilla. It's the integration of these two extremes that make this Barolo so important.
96
319
Seductive and complex, the inviting aromas mix incense, blueberries, cassis, licorice and threads of herb and graphite. Flavors are wrapped tightly and unfold gracefully through a long finish. The herbal side of Cabernet is noted without being intrusive. Classic, deep and expressive.
95
320
A structured wine, with great density of fruit, richness of  texture and at the same time acidity. Its black fruit and red berry flavors are pure and very linear while also giving the wine a full-bodied character.
95
321
The grandest of all white Burgundy vineyards, Montrachet has produced a powerful, great wine, with impressive ripe, dense fruit. There is still elegance, a sense of proportion, but the opulence of the Chardonnay here is impossible to resist.
95
322
Massive, flamboyantly rich, a real treasure in the mouth. Just dazzles with the intensity of cherries, black raspberries, Dr. Pepper, plums, sweet vanilla-scented sandalwood and a wild array of savory spices. The wine is a small-production barrel selection from the estate vineyard, which is in the heart of the Green Valley. Drink now and through 2013, at least.
95
323
A powerful, classic Chambertin, intensely structured and tannic. The sweet black fruit is potentially enormous, still finding its place among the tannins. Spice, with a mineral streak, gives the wine added complexity. Very dense in texture, this will age 10 years and many more.
95
324
A very rich wine, showing all the opulence of 2009. Black plums, damsons and wood flavors are already combined and integrated. The acidity in all this richness and power seems low, leaving the tannins to support aging.
95
325
Almost over the top, this beautiful Barolo from the most celebrated cru of them all—the iconic Cannubi vineyard—delivers maximum pleasure and intensity. This is a soft and velvety wine, with cherry, cassis, leather, moist tobacco and licorice aromas over extracted concentration and tight tannins. The wine needs more time to age and once it does, it can be paired with beef or aged cheeses.
95
326
This is the first wine to be blended each year, though it is not labeled a reserve. The new vintage has amazing depth, running down through a litany of red and black fruits, into veins of earth and tannin and graphite, and finishing with densely textured barrel notes of toast, coffee and bitter chocolate. Beautifully proportioned, deep and cellarworthy.
95
327
This is easily the richest, densest, most complex of Marimar's 2007 Chardonnays. Made with extended lees contact, it has a fleshy, yeasty freshness that gives the wine extra layers. The grape flavors show typical Green Valley long hangtime notes of exotic tropical fruits, apricots, pears, honey, buttered toast, crème brûlée and sweet baking spices, brightened with acidity. A luxurious, splendid Chardonnay to drink now.
95
328
Pio Cesare and the 2007 vintage marry beautifully to produce a layered, opulent, textured, rich wine that is bursting with zesty red fruit, sassy spice, leather and toasted espresso bean. What really sets this wine apart is the dense smoothness of its texture. Save this bottle in your cellar 10 years or more.
95
329
This is full of fruit and weighty tannins. Coming from one of the finest vineyards in Burgundy, it is going to have great power and an opulent nature. This wine also has elegance, its black fruits controlled and with a mineral edge. That doesn't take away the power, it enhances the stylishness of this grand wine. Drink from 2020.
96
330
Initially, this is a richly ripe wine with tropical fruit flavors. It also has an immense sense of structure that supports the fruit impressively. It's dense, concentrated, exuding power and solidity, while always keeping a sense of elegance. Drink from 2018.
96
331
This is powerful and rich, allowing just a note of freshness to creep into the firm structure. Dark tannins, black fruits and smoky wood flavors combine harmoniously, lending a sense of great power and long-term aging potential. Drink from 2019.
96
332
This could be the best Astrales to date. Alluring scents of plum, blueberry and spice are backed by balsam dust and briary pipe-tobacco aromas. Deep and tannic on the palate, then packed with mocha, chocolate, toasted marshmallow, cassis and cherry cough drop flavors, this is fixed and firm now, with a staunch, intense, nervy finish. Drink from 2015–2028.
96
333
Not an obvious wine by any stretch, this riserva opens slowly and bashfully to deliver small pulses of cherry, chocolate and smoked bacon that build in intensity and power as the wine gains momentum in the glass. The tannins are present but are soft and firm without any bitter astringency. Age 10 years or more.
95
334
This attractive Brunello presents a wild, brambly side, with aromas of wild mushroom, forest floor, small berry and crème de cassis. It boasts a beautiful, deep color and plenty of concentration, with endnotes of spice, leather and dried tobacco leaf. The mouthfeel is solid, well defined and superbly structured.
95
335
A pretty and lusciously layered Brunello with dark fruit, spice, leather, tobacco and rum cake aromas. The wine is dense and chewy, with a tight, velvety feel. Dark fruit and spice push the wine across the palate, and both the acidity and tannins are softer than in other 2006 riservas.
95
336
This 2007 Brunello is a big, opulent pleasure bomb with lavish layers, loaded thickly on top of each other: Chocolate fudge, dark cherry, blackberry preserves, rum cake, prune, exotic spice, pipe tobacco, cola, humus and leather. It shows huge personality, intensity and staying power, too. All that density is backed by solid tannins and a steady firmness. Hold 10–15 years.
95
337
From Tuscany's celebrated Frescobaldi wine family, Brunello Castelgiocondo opens with dark, inky concentration and bold aromas of pressed rose, black cherry, exotic spice, leather and unsweetened chocolate. It is beautifully put together, with ample intensity, balance, complexity and silkiness on the finish.
95
338
Poggio all'Oro (a wine only produced in the best vintages) is a sophisticated and austere Brunello with just a tiny dab of sweet spice and red rose aromas on the bouquet. Beyond those are steady, savory pulses of tobacco, leather and dark cedar. The wine is plush, textured and rich, with a polished firmness that keeps it grounded on the palate.
95
339
Red berry, cedar and light spice aromas lead the way on this dazzling red. The vibrant palate is loaded with finesse, delivering bright red currant, red raspberry, white pepper and chopped herb alongside bright acidity and firm, polished tannins. Impeccably balanced, it's loaded with elegance, energy and intensity but it's still young, so give it time to fully develop. Drink 2020–2038.
98
340
This is an incredibly beautiful and yes, joyful, sparkler, made from equal parts Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. This particular offering was disgorged in July 2016. It positively impresses in minerality, complemented by a more fulsome sense of lemon, apple and hazelnut on the creamy palate, leaving a rich trail of silk on the finish.
98
341
This is a beautiful, complex and complete wine, from the delicate, spiced raspberry aroma through the creamy, nuanced finish. Subtle but well-defined fruit flavors like white cherry and raspberry pulse across the palate, buoyed by an ultrafine effervescence and lively acidity. But the texture is smooth around the edges, lending a sense of extra depth and layering to this extraordinary bottle. Just coming into its own now, it will improve through at least 2020.
96
342
An offering meant to toast all manner of celebrations, this wine wows, blending 78% Pinot Noir with 22% Chardonnay in a near-perfect union. Dry and beautifully floral, it opens in a bouquet of marzipan, peach and honey. The mousse is fine, while supporting acidity lends a lemon peel and grapefruit lift. The memory imprinted on the palate will linger long after all the toasts to the happy couple—or whatever else you're celebrating—have been made.
96
343
Earthy aromas of tilled soil, underbrush, leather, purple flower, cedar and ripe black-skinned berry lead the way on this delicious blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Petit Verdot. The smooth full-bodied palate doles out juicy blackberry, red currant, licorice, exotic spice, mocha and a hint of game while tightly knit but velvety tannins lend both structure and finesse. It's already compelling but give it time to fully develop. Drink 2018–2027.
95
344
Clouds of aromatic flower play along with zesty orange flavors. Grapefruit provides spice and drive. The palate shows that counterpoint of ripeness and tartness that makes this so very moreish. This is juicy and powerful, yet precise and toned despite all its generosity. This is a light, tightrope walk between two thrilling worlds. It's full of life and joy with an endless finish.
95
345
Wonderfully concentrated notes of ripe mirabelle plums open up on the nose. There also is a heady lemon note. The palate is rich with the same fleshy ripe fruit but has a fault line of zesty orange at its core that provides focus and seems to illuminate clouds of ripe aromatic citrus at every turn. This shimmers with tangerine and clementine. The body is immensely concentrated but has total direction and drive. Enjoy 2020–2040.
95
346
A designation used only when a vintage deserves, this reserve is definitely worthy. Almost a decade after bottling, it offers an intensity of chocolate, cinnamon and clove against soft, mellowed and structured tannin. Dusty sage and a bramble of blackberry complete the picture. It may have another five to seven years of beauty left within, but why wait?
95
347
The La Jota and W.S. Keyes vineyards are the sources for this classically styled wine that is intense and alive in minerality. Clove, black pepper and mountains of dried herb are front and center between firm, dusty tannin and oak. The texture is plush and velvety on the palate, with plenty of length on the finish.
95
348
The new oak is dialed down a bit to 33% in this memorable red from the producer's estate Quail Hill Vineyard. Lovely in every way, it opens in rose petals and a subtlety of Asian five-spice, before a succulence of cranberry, rhubarb and orange unleash a fullness of fruit and lush texture on the palate.
95
349
Along with a fascinating nose, this bottling from the appellation's westernmost vineyard offers the rounded ripeness of cherimoya, nectarine and white peach but with a laser-sharp line of crushed sea shell and flint minerality alongside scratched lemon skin. The palate rides that chalky line the whole way, offering hints of lime pith, tangerine, sea salt and just enough almond warmth.
95
350
The merest touch of tropicality, of ripe passion fruit, hovers on the nose before lemon and orange kick in. The palate still has an edge of reduction but that is a good and reassuring sign. There is a rich core of ripe poised fruit: tangerine and aromatic oranges are firmly held with grapefruit freshness. There is a beautiful juxtaposition of generosity and tangy freshness. The finish is lip-smacking and utterly fresh—that rich core of fruit invites you to sip and explore again and again.
95
351
Very savory aromas of roasted lamb, bacon fat, teriyaki and crushed pepper meet with light blueberry and a touch of mint on the nose of this delicious, well-rounded bottling by winemaker Sashi Moorman from the vineyard's oldest blocks. The palate kicks off with a zesty acidity, then come waves of black pepper-crusted beef roast, oregano, bay leaf, dark plum fruit and lavender. The solid structure ensures cellar potential but it's ready to drink today.
95
352
This lush, concentrated Viognier combines cool-weather weight with summertime echoes of apricots and honey. Hints of toasty oak provide an ample frame for this full-bodied wine that avoids any sense of oiliness or heaviness while remaining bold, rich and long. Drink now–2020.
95
353
The most gentle strawberry fruit appears unobtrusively on the nose. The palate reveals incredibly pure and honest wild strawberry fruit. The palate is slender but totally concentrated—there is depth to the wine and something ethereal and utterly seductive. This is not about power but about arresting allure. The true nature of Pinot Noir has been captured here, without force, without guile. This is honest and all the more disarming for that.
95
354
Allen Vineyard grapes have the maturity and complexity to impart a boldly balanced roundness of lemon curd, fig and apple, plus a searing undercurrent of salty minerality. With substantial weight, and texture for miles, it remains bright and fresh in the glass, with a lingering impression of cinnamon toast.
95
355
The merest hint of reduction reminds you of how young this wine actually is. On the palate, a very generous full-fruited picture unfolds: there is very ripe juicy yellow pear and countless juicy citrus notions of clementine, tangerine, satsuma and orange. All of this is cut with precise, tart and ripe lemon freshness. This interplay of tart and ripe creates tension and drive. This is lovely now but is a powerhouse of potent long-lasting fruit. Drink 2017–2040.
95
356
Delicious notions of ripe greengages haunt the nose, alongside fragrant orange peel. The palate is still taut and tight, sprightly and streamlined, as if powered and propelled forward by invisible citrus force. There is such drive and precision here, you almost feel movement and speed. The finish is clean but clearly this is for the longer run. It will take bottle age for this to reveal its scented, fruit-laden core. Drink 2022–2040.
95
357
The gentlest hint of the purest ripe apricot aroma rises from the glass. There is the merest touch of blossom honey before the palate opens up into a nirvana of apricot and rounded aromatic orange and mandarin flavors. This is clean, precise and impressive—a picture postcard of the sunny 2015 vintage. This may be charming now but, wait a few years and it will be lethal. Drink now–2030.
95
358
A prime example of why Pinot Noir is great to release later in its life, this six-year-old wine is signing with concentrated strawberry, iron, dried rose petals, stewed black cherry and raw beef. The palate is quite earthy but also packs black plum, vanilla, pepper, thyme and marjoram into a wondrous and complete package.
95
359
This is a major wine from a great white wine vintage that's naturally impressive and intense. Ripe white and yellow fruit dominates the palate, sustained by wood aging flavors and tight, nervy texture. Bâtard-Montrachet is largest of the five white Grand Crus in Puligny and Chassagne Montrachet. Drink from 2024.
98
360
The highly sought-after, perennially beautiful and brawny Hillside Select is 100% estate grown and 100% varietal. It wows after three years in barrel, painting a lush picture of tobacco, tea and firm, integrated tannin dusted in smoky clove scents. Intensely peppery, its youthful blackberry and cherry flavors shine through but will benefit from even more time in bottle, through 2032.
98
361
This is a powerhouse of a wine—structured and dense yet still developing and closed at this young stage. There's already a sense of both fruit richness and mineral texture, underpinned by oak spice, yet it will grow more powerful with time. Drink from 2023.
97
362
The largest of the four grands crus in Morey-Saint-Denis, this vineyard gives the most structured wines. This bottling, with its tannins and power, is no exception. While it shows plenty of rich black, perfumed fruit, it also has an immense structure of tight tannins are balanced by juicy acidity. Drink from 2027.
97
363
This wine produced from vines on the Corton hill is dense and dark, with great power and concentration. Its rich, dark fruit is paired with intense, juicy acidity, ensuring slow development over many years. Drink from 2025.
96
364
Although there is some Trincadeira in the blend, this legendary wine is really a paean to Alicante Bouschet. Produced in traditional open stone fermenters, it exudes power and density. Black plum and berry fruit contends with concentrated tannins that are still very much in evidence. Determinedly old style in approach, it will age for many years. Drink from 2021.
96
365
From vines inside the Les Clos Grand Cru purchased in 1904 from the Hospices de Chablis, this is a richly structured wine. It's dense with layers of flavor and great aging potential. Wood and smoky flavors are still calming down to give a wine that will be impressive and long-lived. Drink from 2023.
96
366
This high-toned, lovely wine is a best-of blend from several vineyards—primarily Ritchie and Banfield. Sugar pie apple and fig flavors form a robustly concentrated fruitiness that's ribbed with vibrant minerality. A clarified butter-like creaminess comes through on the finish.
96
367
From one of the larger of the great grands crus of Vosne-Romanée and Flagey-Echézeaux, this is a dark, structured wine. It has power and juicy acidity that drive its black plum and berry fruit flavors. A dry core of tannins promises many years of maturing. Drink from 2026.
96
368
Red berry, wild mint, crushed rose, forest floor and new leather are just some of the aromas you'll find on this fragrant delicious red. Seamlessly boasting structure and finesse, the full-bodied palate displays layers of succulent morello cherry, raspberry compote, licorice and cinnamon while firm velvety tannins lend support and a polished texture. A savory saline note wraps up the lingering finish. Drink 2018–2026.
96
369
Beautifully balanced, this opens with alluring scents of wild berry, rose, baking spice and whiffs of chopped herb.

It's already tempting but the best is yet to come. Drink 2021–2031.
96
370
Next door to the top grand cru of Chambertin, this vineyard, with its east-facing exposure, is one of the stars of Gevrey-Chambertin. This vintage is hugely rich—ripe with voluminous fruit and smoky hints from the wood aging. It has density and the potential for long aging. Drink from 2025.
96
371
A testament to the power of Paso Robles' wines, this blend of 37% Grenache, 34% Mourvèdre and 29% Syrah is dense, dark and viscous, showing candied blackberry, crème de cassis and pressed violet aromas, accented with cola and mocha notes. Soft, lush tannins massage the palate, growing grippier with time, while boisterous acidity releases blackberry, espresso and crushed slate flavors. Immensely likable now, it will also last for years.
95
372
Truffle, forest floor, baked plum and cake spice aromas mingle with whiffs of new leather and pipe tobacco on this bold full-bodied red. The enveloping palate seamlessly combines concentration and finesse, doling out fleshy black cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, licorice and mocha alongside big velvety tannins that give the finish nice grip and a polished texture. This will give decades of enjoyment. Drink 2020–2037.
95
373
This grand cru bottling comes from vines owned by Louis Jadot. It's firmly structured, as befits a wine from this village, and shows a predominance of red fruit and acidity. However, with its dry core and concentration, it will need to age. Drink from 2025.
95
374
This is made in tiny amounts, which is heartbreakingly sad given its deliciousness and provenance, the grapes hailing from the Rochioli Sweetwater site on Westside Road. Spice box and sweet black-cherry flavors are lightly oaked and layered with velvety texture, the wine full-bodied and totally balanced.
95
375
Electric acidity and pure, pristine fruit collide in this full
