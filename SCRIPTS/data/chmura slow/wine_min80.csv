133
Chunky, wayward aromas are vague at best. This has no structural integrity, while waxy green-apple flavors come with bitterness and a flabby, oily finish. Barely passable.
80
134
After the sulfur smell blows off, this wine remains tough in acids and tannins.
80
135
A blend of five diverse red grapes, this lightly fruity quaffer is almost invisible as far as flavor is concerned. It hits the tongue and vanishes.
80
136
Too sweet in sugary blackberry jam to earn a higher score, but if that's your liking, go for it.
80
137
Sweet melon and peach aromas are candied. In the mouth, this is awkward, fizzy and cloying. The flavor profile has little positive to offer, while the finish turns bitter and grassy tasting.
80
138
A barrel fermented Chardonnay that is uncharacteristically soft and fruity. Aromas of bananas and bubble gum lead to slightly sweet, uncomplicated flavors. The texture and body are light.
80
139
The cold, rainy conditions of 2008 must have affected this wine. Vegetal aromas, vinegar and green notes drive the nose, while the flavor profile is briny and pickled to an extreme. High acidity and green flavors draw down the finish.
80
140
This white Garnacha is strange smelling, with a mix of cream soda, pickled fruit and vanilla aromas. It's tart, briny and citrusy on the palate, with a sour finish.
80
141
This blend of 75% Barbera and 25% Merlot smells and tastes of strawberries in dirt, a strange sensation for a wine.
80
142
A Rhône-style blend of mostly Grenache and Mourvédre, with smaller amounts of Syrah and Cinsault, the wine is prune-like and overdone.
80
143
On the sweet side, this offers a soft texture, a slightly bitter edge and a pruny fruit flavor.
80
144
Animal cracker aromas are sweet and the fruit on the nose is mealy on this Viura-Chardonnay blend. The palate is also deficient in that it's watery in feel, but there's some tangy lemon to the flavor profile.
80
145
If it weren't for a fresh, reasonable mouthfeel, this would be a disaster. Aromatically, it's all pyrazines and funk. Flavorwise, it's herbaceous and rough, like celery and nettles. Bitter on the finish.
80
146
This Chardonnay has a prominent scent of dusty chalkboard, with background tones of toasted butterscotch, sweat and pear. The flavor intensity is subdued on this light- to medium-bodied wine, with a discreet note of hydrogen peroxide that surfaces late.
80
147
This is leafy and red smelling at first, then becoming raw and candied tasting, with a herbal note.
80
148
Smells strange, as if juniper berries were blended with tomato and weedy red fruits. Scratchy and herbal in the mouth, with game and other oddball flavors. Finishes gummy and confected, with a final blast of green herbs and weeds.
80
149
Heavy and soupy in its current state. This is one chunked-out white wine that is barely hanging on with flavors of papaya and dried-out peach. Has lost whatever freshness it may have had.
80
150
Tastes old, tired and vegetal, with modest berry flavors. It's also too soft and sweet. The alcohol seems higher and hotter than the official reading of 14.3%.
80
151
Green and funky smelling, with a grassy, tomato character. Sticky and unctuous on the palate, with a strange, weedy set of red fruit flavors. Finishes creamy and weak; barely acceptable but still not fresh or well balanced.
80
152
Oxidized and mute, with mushy, nutty flavors and a similar finish. An underperformer that lacks freshness, purity and character.
80
153
Overly perfumed, with burnt notes, wayward sulfur and acridness at the wine's core. The palate is fleshy and low in acidity, with bitterness to the white fruit flavors that are none too clean. Offers very little that's redeeming.
80
154
Blended from Syrah, Mourvèdre and the two Cabernets, Sauvignon and Franc, this wine feels bitter and acidic in the mouth. It's very tannic and overripe, with flavors of prunes.
80
155
There's a harsh edge to this wine, made by a Vermont-based winery from California grapes. Its aromas and flavors are elusive and the wine, if it's to be drunk at all, should be drunk soon.
80
156
Forced together and not happily married is the only way to describe this dysfunctional coupling of sweet, tropical Torrontes and heavy, cloying Chardonnay. Too sweet for most palates, with a heavy dosage of melon, lychee and table sugar.
80
157
Big and purple, with sweet aromas. But the palate is very uneven, with acute acidity that scours and turns the plum and grape flavors sour. Grabby mouthfeel as well, with clamp.
80
158
There's not much point in making a reserve-style wine if the barrels are subpar. Aggressive menthol and sappy green-barrel aromas and flavors dominate this wine. There's good weight and texture, just not much in the way of vinous flavor.
80
159
Rough, grassy aromas and flavors along with a choppy mouthfeel render this one rung above unacceptable. Overall, this is about as raw, punchy, green and herbaceous as a Malbec can get.
80
160
This affordable sparkler starts off with odd, funky aromas that suggest bananas and mushy papaya. The flavors aren’t bad, but the wine is austere and awkward, with a rough texture that offers little pleasure. It’s just drinkable.
80
161
The berry flavors in this wine are fighting to emerge, but they are overwhelmed by dusty tannins and a lack of texture.
80
162
This smells and tastes like raspberry bubblegum, with a taste of white sugar.
80
163
An herbal cherry aroma comes with notes of leather and mulchy earth. It feels and tastes dried out, with tart, grating acidity and medicinal, herbal flavors on the finish.
80
164
This mature PN from a hot vintage isn't showing much life. Earthy, raisiny aromas aren't fresh, while wood tannin and acid are keeping it afloat. Flavors of brown sugar and decayed berry fruits finish stale. This is on its very last legs.
80
165
Aromas of sweet corn and melon are not convincing. This has little in the way of mouthfeel or substance; flavors of candied fruits taste like corn and wheat, while the finish is spineless.
80
166
Bland citrus and a yeasty note seem out of character for a normally very aromatic varietal. This wine is light, supersimple and drinks like water.
80
167
Tastes sour and bone dry, with grapefruit flavors.
80
168
Nothing more than cherry soda aromas to get it going. It's highly confected, with decent acidity its only saving grace.
80
169
Angular and overcrowded with rhubarb aromas and flavors. There isn't any finesse to this wine and only a modicum of acceptable fruit and body. Tart at the core.
80
170
Sweeter than in the past, this blend of Cabernet, Merlot, Sangiovese and Cab Franc has overtly sugary flavors of blackberry and cherry pie filling that are not appropriate in a table wine.
80
171
Difficult to find much to like here. Smells baked and Porty, and tastes overtly sweet in residual sugar, like cherry and raspberry jam.
80
172
Full and overly chunky, but ultimately off-kilter. Too sweet and gummy.
80
173
Soft and dull, with vegetal and blackberry flavors that finish sweet and cloying.
80
174
High in alcohol, excessively soft and sweet in sugar, this Zin leaves much to be desired.
80
175
Tastes like orange, apricot and cherry sweet-and-sour sauce you get in a Chinese restaurant over pork or chicken. The flavors are of those fruits, with some white sugar and rice vinegar.
80
176
Strangely colored, with oyster shell aromas and weird orange-influenced flavors. Not exactly sweet but not dry either, this is borderline wine made from Cabernet and Malbec. Imported by North American Beverage Group.
80
177
This is a sweet, raw blend of Syrah, Grenache, Petite Sirah, Mourvèdre and Cinsault. Not going anywhere.
80
178
Sugary sweet, with flavors of cherry jam and LifeSaver raspberry candy.
80
179
Gritty and corny on the nose, and frankly it's almost acrid.  Bitter; the only fruit that comes up is banana.
80
180
With its vegetal smell and saccharine-sweet, medicinal fruit flavors, this is not a successful Zinfandel.
80
181
Too sweet by far, with a white sugary finish to the pineapple and pear flavors. Crisp acidity helps to provide a framework of balance, but the sweetness really feeds into the perception that California white wines have residual sugar.
80
182
Strange aromas of tree bark, pool water and funky berry fruit are not inviting. This organic Cabernet feels awkward and grabby, while flavors of jammy berry fruits finish flabby, wayward and with little charm.
80
183
Pollen and wilted-flower tones are mild on the nose. Watery lychee and peach flavors are the markers for the flabby, sugary palate.
80
184
Blurred edges characterize the non-distinct apple fruit. The palate has edges of bitterness that the residual sugar cannot masks.
80
185
SweeTART candies and green Jolly Rancher aromas are like a punch in the face. Green apple-cider flavors carry the flabby, sweet palate.
80
186
Murky in color and like pure raisin juice on the nose, this alarmingly unbalanced, raisiny Cab holds mild enjoyment.
80
187
Neutral on the nose, with hints of peach and melon, this Chenin is flabby and struggling to stay afloat. Lightly oxidized, yeasty flavors of apricot and melon finish with barely a pulse.
80
188
Very light, even thin, this white lacks the stuffing sought in a simple quaffing white. There are no overtly off-putting elements here, there's just not much here at all. —M.M.
80
189
What slight dark cherry fruit there is in this light '97 is submerged under the oak. It's a bit brown at the edges and overwooded. —M.M.
80
190
The apple, hay and earth aromas and flavors of this Chardonnay from northeastern Spain are in the right range, but lack the liveliness and definition I sought. Medium-weight, it finishes a bit short, a bit dull and uninspired. —M.M.
80
191
Soft, chunky and fading fast, with aromas of asparagus and canned green beans. The palate is flat as a board, with vegetal flavors and bitterness on the finish. Barely worth a sip at this point in its evolution.
80
192
If it weren't for the wine's stout color and pretty good mouthfeel, we'd sink it. The nose is green and cheesy, and the flavors are also green almost to the point of vegetal. Stemmy on the finish.
80
193
Yellow and chunky, and definitely on the way toward the grave. Mustardy aromas are severely short on freshness, and the palate is just as flat, dull and mealy as the nose. A weird, low-acid blend of Chardonnay, Viognier and Chenin Blanc.
80
194
Flat and gaseous smelling, with sulfur and no fruit to speak of. Tastes like bland nectarine and tangerine, and the body and finish are almost flabby. Borderline in terms of its acceptability.
80
195
Wines like this are why Argentina would be best served sticking to reds. This has no bouquet to speak of, and the palate is dilute, tangy, citrusy and sharp. Acceptable but that's it.
80
196
Way too charred and roasted. The mouthfeel is acceptable and ranks as the best part of the wine. The rest is just a burnt, charred, overoaked mess with flavors of earthy berry, leather, peanut and resin. A poor effort that makes you wonder what the winery was thinking.
41
Simple and Porty, with baked berry flavors that finish sharp and astringent.
80
42
Phebus is a new label from Fabre Montmayou, and frankly this wine has issues. It smells a lot like gumballs and a wet, dirty dog. It doesn't have much substance or flow, and that gamy, wet-dog character is persistent, even on the flavor profile.
80
43
Vegetal and watery, a very dry wine that offers little in the way of fruit. Tastes like alcohol with a drop or two of grapefruit juice.
80
44
Fruits, flowers and spice should lead the nose and bathe the palate with this Nebbiolo, but the wine falls flat, with bitter, sweet flavors that are astringent in nature and lack elegance.
80
45
A soft, medicinal and uninteresting wine, marked by harshness and green flavors that barely suggest cherries.
80
46
Thin, dry and harsh, with cola flavors that are so thin, all you can really detect is the heat of alcohol. If you're not fussy, it's a basic introduction to Pinot Noir.
80
47
A red Rhône blend that's too soft, hot and sweet. It has the taste of sugary raspberry jam and is not a dry table wine.
80
48
Soft and awkward, with dull berry flavors that have a vegetal tinge.
80
49
A sweet, high-fueled blend of Chardonnay, Muscat Blanc and old-vine Trebbiano from a newly approved appellation called the Sierra Pelona Valley, north of Los Angeles, this wine has peach and lemon peel hiding behind a lathering of oak.
80
50
Just barely drinkable. It's not dirty or anything, but watery and very fruity.
80
51
Reedy, herbaceous aromas suggest rhubarb and red licorice candy. This feels flat and lays heavily on the palate, while candied flavors of cherry and berry finish hot.
80
52
Gold in color, with a chunky palate and pushy, reduced, mealy flavors of grapefruit. Vegetal on the finish. Tasted twice with identical results.
80
53
Watery and sweet, with apricot and orange jam flavors.
80
54
Soft, sweet and simple raspberry and oak flavors mark this rustic wine.
80
55
Cherry cough drop aromas are candied and ominous. This feels diluted, tastes herbal and green, and finishes minty.
80
56
The color of castor oil, this sweet table wine offers clove and root beer flavors that cling to the finish.
80
57
Tropical, soapy aromas are yeasty and flat. Flavors of lychee and melon have no follow-through and finish mealy.
80
58
Candied plum and red berry aromas smell like red licorice. Flavors are raisiny, with sourness and astringency.
80
59
There isn't much to love about this weedy abrasive high-acid Tempranillo. Green and grassy in flavor, with a minty acidic finish, this is barely cutting it as a whole.
80
60
Chemicalized aromas of lemon peel and turpentine are offputting. This feels bland and tastes oxidized and bitter.
80
61
This red-colored barrel-fermented rosé of Tempranillo and Merlot smells funky and gummy. Flat on the palate, this tastes of pickled red cabbage: charmless and difficult to get through.
80
62
Muddled candied aromas smell uniquely unnatural and forced. This is choppy and jagged in the mouth, while a strange set of fake-oak and murky berry flavors are prominently on display.
80
63
This is mucky and sweet. Its best foot is not put forward via the compost-like nose, and from then on there's little more than prune, leather and a sticky mouthfeel.
80
64
Too powerful in feline and gooseberry aromas and flavors, this dry, tart in-your-face Sauvignon Blanc just isn't ripe enough to recommend.
80
65
Greenwood Ridge often does a good job at Sauvignon Blanc, but not this year. The wine is irritating in unripe feline flavors and it's also off-dry, with 1.9% residual sugar.
80
66
This unoaked Sauvignon Blanc is really powerful in feline characteristics. Too powerful. Unless you like that peculiar smell and taste, it will turn you off.
80
67
There's something not right about the way this winery is fermenting its Cavas because both this and Oriol Rossell's regular brut are excessively foamy. As a result, this gran reserva's apple and spice aromas and flavors are rendered moot by the gaseous explosion that occurs when liquid hits palate.
80
68
Eight grapes comprise this weird, peanutty, almost dirty red blend. The nose is like a salad of bitter greens and peanut vinaigrette, and the palate shows big fruit, bigger tannins and then a finish of asparagus and green beans. Imported by USA Wines Inc.
80
69
Smells and tastes like caramel and stewed cherry and blackberry flavors that taste overtly sweet. However, this rustic blend of Syrah and Sangiovese may have its fans.
80
70
Port-like, with raisiny, baked cherry and caramel flavors. Finishes dry.
80
71
This diluted wine opens with aromas suggesting old cut flowers and wet soil. The thin watery palate has just a hint of unripe sour cherry.
80
72
Funky, heavily pickled aromas lack clarity, charm and cleanliness. This feels flat as a board, with bitter sour nutty flavors of spoiled citrus fruits. A sour, murky finish fails to help it along.
80
73
Oddly tropical and floral, like an Argentine Torrontés. Spritzy in the mouth but weird tasting and funky, with cloying, unusual flavors that frankly don't taste very good.
80
74
Roasted, herbal and blunt, with an acrid stemminess. The palate lacks ripeness and elegance as it delivers burnt, leafy, herbal flavors. Underwhelming.
80
75
A heavy, acidic and boring wine, not offering much in the way of flavor except for some bitter cherries.
80
76
Average peach and apple aromas are as good as it gets. The palate is wet, heavy, charmless and cidery, with aggressive apple and citrus flavors. And oak wouldn't likely help it.
80
77
Neutral aromas, sour apple and citrus flavors, a spritzy mouthfeel and soda-like on the finish. Unsophisticated to a fault.
80
78
The aromas of this wine are gummy and candied on the nose. Weird flavors of pastry, mulched earth and clay are devoid of clean fruit and finish jumbled and flat.
80
79
Rusty in color, with rubbery cherry and raspberry aromas, this is a sticky, candied rosé with a low freshness quotient. Candied, sugary flavors finish sweet and gooey.
80
80
This wine is flawed, with rustic leathery undertones that veer into Band-Aid, and an intensely sour note. Multiple bottles tried over several months.
80
81
This Merlot has not fully ripened, with aromas of bell pepper, green herbs and savory notes overriding any sense of variety. Flavors are faint and lighter in style, trailing on the finish.
80
82
Barely drinkable, with sweet, sugary flavors and a few drops of citrus fruit.
80
83
Tropical, citrusy aromas are about as good as this gets. The palate is cloying and the flavors of banana and burnt sugar finish sticky.
80
84
Even at this price, this Cab is hard to like. It's soft and somewhat vegetal, with bizarre sweet oak and cherry jam flavors.
80
85
Grassy, herbaceous, raisiny aromas are green and harsh. This is brutally tannic and out of whack on the palate, while green, weedy flavors finish thick, blocky and rough.
80
86
This vivid pink-colored wine tastes of candy with added acidity. There is some sweetness along with the artificial flavors.
80
87
Gritty aromas of asphalt, licorice and especially clove are off the beaten path. Flavors of dried clove, pepper and wood smoke are dominant and don't allow for any fruit to show through. A finish that tastes like pure clove is in its own zip code. Tasted twice.
80
88
Not a good year for this wine, which is green and fuzzy on the tongue, a strange waft of chemical overpowering over all.
80
89
Vegetal and metallic on the nose, this Verdejo fails to improve as it goes along. It's dilute in feel, with celery and grassy flavors. It finishes bitter and flabby.
80
90
The wine shows a maderized color and aromas of oxidized stone fruits and rubber. This fast-fading rosé feels flat, with mushy flavors of peach, melon and mushroom. Bitterness rises up on the finish.
80
91
This wine has a burnt rubber, mouth-puckering and slightly chemical undertone in aroma and taste.
80
92
Murky, stewy, soupy aromas deliver little to no freshness or fruit, while the palate is tannic and tastes bitter, mildly weedy and minty. Seems roasted and devoid of quality. Unclean and unimpressive.
80
93
Smells like corn stalks and also of oxidation. The palate is wet but shapeless, and the flavors are waxy and jumbled. It's yet another pass-it-by, underperforming Mendoza Chardonnay.
80
94
The nose offers earthy, medicinal notes on the light black-cherry fruit. Thin on the palate, it has a cough syrup-like taste. The tannins are soft, the acids low. Finishes short.
80
95
Rather dilute, it shows slight black-cherry and blackberry aromas and flavors. The overall impression is really little more than alcohol and faint body. Finishes very dry, with innocuous tannins.
80
96
Sometimes Franc can have a lovely, alluringly floral bouquet; other times it can be downright vegetal and display green-bean characteristics. Unfortunately, this is an example of the latter. The wine has nice weight and texture, so if you don't mind your veggies in liquid form this might be more to your liking.
80
97
Vanilla, butterscotch and some harsher oak-derived compounds dominate the modest citrus fruit that might have been wine before it was turned into oak juice. For wood lovers only.
80
98
This is Langetwins's first vintage of Malbec from estate vineyards and it leaves a bit to be desired. Flat and a tad watery, it's a one-dimensional quaff.
80
99
Of all the Cavas made by Freixenet, this oddly sweet Spumante is the weakest. This is briny, pickled and candied on the nose, with hints of lychee and banana. Flavors of Sprite, cane sugar and banana finish with sulfur, honeydew and a faux kiwi note.
80
100
A chilly vintage took its toll on this Maddalena, robbing the wine of ripeness and resulting in a green, slightly vegetal wine.
80
101
Oily, match-stick aromas are none too friendly, and no199
This has fierce acidity, and is sweet in cherry jam flavors, with some unripe, green notes.
80
200
This smells like compost. It feels hard and clacky, with sharp acidity and weedy, minty flavors that finish rough and green.
80
201
This starts with aromas of cinnamon, hard candy and weedy red fruits. It feels sugary and broken, with candied strawberry flavors in front of a sweet, confected finish.
80
202
This has aromas of prunes and burnt rubber, but it tastes better than that. It's a pretty raw effort.
80
203
Murky and stewy smelling, with no vitality and overt green accents. It's a bit heavy in feel, with salsa-like flavors of tomato, tomatillo, chili pepper and herbs.
80
204
This yellow-colored blend is weird and wooly, with aromas of blowsy apricot and herbs. A pulpy, melony palate is creamy and odd in feel, with nectarine and chunky peach flavors that turn rubbery on the finish.
80
205
A pop style of pink wine that the Peter Mondavi family makes from Zinfandel with minor portions of Chenin Blanc and Muscat. It has a light coral color, mild fruit aromas and semisweet red Popsicle flavors.
80
206
This offers allspice aromas around a thin core of hard-to-decipher fruit and a finish that veers into burnt-rubber territory.
80
207
This Petite Sirah has a strong aroma of farm and funk, and not much else to distinguish itself.
80
208
Stalky and oxidized on the nose, this becomes cidery, high in acid in the mouth, with sour-lemon flavors.
80
209
Jammy aromas of candied red fruits and raisin lead into the palate, with red-fruit flavors and a sticky, bitter finish.
80
210
This Malbec shows massive amounts of barrel influence and a strong element of diesel fuel, which takes a while to blow off.
80
211
Pale salmon color and slightly bricked, this wine displays aromas of geranium, dried herbs and strawberry. It drinks off dry, with lightly spritzy herb flavors.
80
212
An unclean nose smells cheesy. This is flabby and flat, with no acidity. Thus the flavors are sugary and soft, with no spunk. Overall, this struggles to keep up with what's on the market.
80
213
Candied-raspberry aromas are soapy and strange. This sweet Tannat from Brazil is hollow yet cloying, with candied-cherry flavors that don't cut it. While not undrinkable, this just isn't good.
80
214
Strange yeasty unfocused aromas are unclean. This is flat and spineless, with yeasty papaya flavors. A diluted, leesy finish confirms that it's not ready for prime time.
80
215
Cidery, citric and jumbled on the nose and palate, this is barely cutting it. Briny, limited flavors of mealy citrus fruits finish flat.
80
216
This is a heartbeat or two from being DOA. Tan in color with an oily heavy mouthfeel, this tastes oxidized and shows almost no pulse.
80
217
Herbaceous red-fruit and forced fiery oak aromas give this a spicy, almost Pinot Noir-like nose. Raw as nails on the palate, this tastes like herbal green strawberry and chemicals. Weedy on the finish.
80
218
Lean and rather dry, this has old wood and lean fruit flavors.
80
219
This has medicinal, sweet-tasting flavors of chocolate and cherry.
80
220
This is just barely drinkable, with modest blackberry fruit. It's hot and Port-like, right through the raisiny finish.
80
221
This tastes soft, sweet and simple. The blend is Pinot Gris, Chardonnay, Columbard and Gewurztraminer.
80
222
This is dark, amorphous and shows almost nothing in the way of Pinot Noir character. It feels globular, tasting of beets and leather. Pruny and bitter on the finish.
80
223
This very ripe wine tastes of supermature grapes; it' s soft and formless.
80
224
Raisin and funky leather are the prime aromas on this marginal Tempranillo. Expect a dried-out, tart and herbal wine, with a raisiny sweetness.
80
225
Mulchy and gaseous on the nose, this subsequently turns scouring and acidic on the palate, with a leafy, dry red-plum flavor. Herbal, dry and not very fruity overall.
80
226
This bland, overoaked Chardonnay is dilute, with aromas of clove but no fruit. A watery palate tastes woody and bitter, with another shot of unwanted clove on the finish.
80
227
A very neutral wine, this has some earthy spice on the palate, but is almost bare of fruit. It's clean and neutral but not refreshing.
80
228
Flavors of apple are spoiled by notes of mud and pondwater on the nose. The palate is bitter and undefined.
80
229
The nose is subdued while the palate shows some apple and yellow-plum fruit. This is simple and fresh but shows a bitter edge and some dilution.
80
230
Almost, but not quite, undrinkable, this Zin is vegetal and dry, with asparagus-tinged flavors of berries.
80
231
Harsh and gaseous on the nose, with rustic aromas and no sense of polish. Tastes like burnt sugar and melted candy, with a soupy finish.
80
232
Harsh and rustic, this Cab has disagreeably strong tannins and green flavors that barely suggest blackberries.
80
233
This is two consecutive vintages of sketchy to poor rosé from this label. This one smells a bit like a swimming pool, while the flavors are of tart nectarine and pickle. Doesn't much cut it.
80
234
Raw and harsh, with green, unripe tannins framing simple berry jam flavors.
80
235
Good price, but the wine is green and unripe, with that unpleasant meow odor that turns many people off.
80
236
Curiously dusty wine, tasting of under-ripe cranberry with a coating of sweetness. While it is identifiably Sauvignon Blanc, it does seem to have missed out on the region's signature minerality. Screwcap.
80
237
Maderized and stalky smelling, with a scratchy palate and grassy, pickled flavors that lean toward strawberry and raspberry.
80
238
Best on the nose, where apple and lemony aromas are true. In the mouth, it's foamy and crude, with crushing citrus and cidery flavors. Rough, bubbly and massive; tough stuff to swallow.
80
239
Too high in alcohol and too overtly sweet in sugar. Tastes like an inexpensive Port.
80
240
Hits with barrel resin and not much else. Feels screechy and shrill, with a swath of wood tannin. Acidity pushes it along in the mouth, but this is really all about resiny wood.
80
241
Clumsy and a bit chemical smelling, with a sticky, thick, candied palate housing bug juice berry flavors in front of a medicinal finish. Bulky, sweet and grabby red wine.
80
242
Barely drinkable, although you'll get by at big parties where nobody cares. It's silky, sweet and minty.
80
243
This Lodi wine has a whirl of smoky, oaky flavors, plus a not entirely pleasant green tinge to its finish.
80
244
This is raw, sour, tangy and loaded with juniper and pine notes.
80
245
Eggy, sulfuric and gritty on the nose, with acrid, burnt-field aromas. The palate runs toward grapefruit and bland citrus, and the finish is dull. Barely an acceptable effort given the norm these days.
80
246
A gaseous, barnyardy wine from several vintages ago. It's tart and scratchy, with thin herbal flavors of red fruit and tomato. Doesn't seem worth much these days.
80
247
An aggressive wine with very little charm or character to back up its edgy verve. The nose is skunky while the palate tastes of pickled red cabbage and sharp berry flavors. A weak product reflective of a cool, nongiving vintage.
80
248
Shows sugary flavors of apricots, grilled pineapples and vanilla that have a troubling vegetal edge.
80
249
Dull and vegetal. Tastes like canned asparagus juice, with a squeeze of citrus.
80
250
Stalky, burnt aromas are hardly the welcome mat one is looking for. In the mouth, this is sweet and soft, with a syrupy mouthfeel and candied flavors of berry fruits that come across fake in nature. This is 100% manipulated in style.
80
251
Mild, powdery and innocuous on the nose, this boxed wine is dilute and citrusy in the mouth, with tart orange and lime flavors.
80
252
In possibly the world's heaviest bottle comes this heavy Ancient Vine Zinfandel, greasy in bacon fat flavor, plus-sized in every way with a taste of sweet cigar smoke from beginning to end.
80
253
All of the new Epica wines from San Pedro seem highly manufactured and sweet. This blend is stalky and murky smelling, then heavy and cloying in the mouth, with sugar-meets-herbal flavors that finish hot and syrupy.
80
254
There's no oak in this Sauvignon Blanc. It's bone dry and shows crisp acidity. The citrus and gooseberry flavors are green with whiffs of ammonia.
80
255
This is dark in color, with apple cider aromas. The flavors are bland and nutty more than fruity, and the finish is the same.
80
256
Could the scent of microwaved popcorn be any stronger? Obviously, it's heavily oaked, and that carries onto the palate where you'll find heavy, woody flavors in addition to banana and lemon. This needs a lot more charm and style; in all honesty, it's not delivering much.
80
257
This one has bland aromatics, with only a touch of oak to grasp at. The palate is almost spritzy, which it shouldn't be, and the flavor resembles Mott's applesauce. A bit weak and only qualifies for an acceptable rating on its best day.
80
258
The nose is sulphuric and a bit barnyardy, which screams“watch out,” but in the mouth there's acceptable if unspectacular apple fruit. It's scratchy in the finish, and probably just this side of not being worth drinking.
80
259
Clear as day in the glass, with forced oak and spring flowers in the nose. In a word, it's strange. In the mouth, you'll get sweetness and other flavors not generally associated with Chardonnay. It's not necessarily a bad white wine, but it is definitely at odds with typical Chardonnay.
80
260
To get the best results, you'd better chill this one down. That way you'll get more of the refreshing apple and pear element of the wine and less of its fat, chunky body and rough, unpolished edges.
261
Another wine from Portal del Alto that's just on the cusp of drinkability. Potent butterscotch and cream aromas don't seem authentic. Resiny flavors mask the fruit, and it finishes flat.
80
262
Strange Chardonnay. It smells and tastes more like feeble Torrontés than Chard. The palate offers only shearing apple fruit, and the finish is hard. Can't imagine anyone pegging this as Chardonnay.
80
263
Soft and gluey, with sweet, jammy flavors of pineapples and butterscotch. Tastes like cough drops.
80
264
Charming aromas of tobacco leaf and strawberries promise good things to come but the palate does not follow through. While some boysenberry flavors appeal, the wine is thin in the mouth. The tannins are a bit overly gripping now but the wine does not have the fruit ripeness or concentration to benefit from cellaring.
80
265
Smells and tastes like inexpensive Port, with caramelized wood, baked cherry and sugared black currant jam notes.
80
266
Orange rind and Chinese spices make for an intriguing opener but the palate falls flat, with little to offer but a few simple lemon and lime flavors. Short finish.
80
267
While the aromas show some promise, they are disappointingly faint for a Gewürztraminer. This wine is an easy quaffer but lacks the palate richness typical of this variety. Crisp acidity and low alcohol (11.7%) make it a good hot weather choice.
80
268
This wine falls short of its rather lofty ambitions with lavish new French oak treatment resulting in a diminished fruit profile. Sawdust notes dominate the nose while the faintest hint of cherry can be detected on the palate. Finishes a bit tart. A good choice for those hankering for a vanilla milkshake.
80
269
Smells vegetal and unripe, with broccoli aromas that turn medicinal sweet in the mouth.
80
270
Crisp and exceptionally low in tannin, the Chancellor grape is perhaps this continent's answer to the Gamay of Beaujolais. The brilliant garnet hue of this example will force you to pick up the glass. Unfotunately, what you find there won't hold your attention for very long. The aromas are pleasant but diffuse and lead to a one-dimensional palate with only a few faint notes of red fruits.
80
271
Not very fruity, with gritty cherry flavors and a hard, edgy, almost sour profile. Does nothing for the reputation of Merlot in Argentina. Overpriced, too.
80
272
Odd notes of Pez candy and confectioner's sugar open this new entry from Southeast Australia. With a watery palate and an almost nonexistent finish, the wine does not make as much of an impression as the catchy name.
80
273
This has overripe tropical-fruit aromas on the nose. Wheaty, oxidized flavors finish with a note of mushy fruit.
80
274
This wine has artificial, plastic-like aromas that mar its opening and make it barely acceptable to drink.
80
275
This wine is a medium cherry-red color, with some bricking. The volatiles are quite high and lead to off-dry cherry flavors.
80
276
A strong wine, both in terms of aromas and flavors. There’s a delicacy and lightness to the body, but the intensity of its flavors is assaultive; it’s a combination of peaches, warm cheese and a hint of something very dry and citrusy. Roquefort notes indicate that there may be some bacteriological problems.
80
277
Confected and soapy with exuberant baby powder and floral tones, this dry, medium-bodied Bulgarian Muskat Ottonel is an uneven, craggy wine with shriekingly high acidity.
80
278
Has a sweaty aroma that's that's hard to get past. In the mouth, the wine is simple, sweet and sharp, with raspberry-mint jelly flavors.
80
279
There's nothing special about this Syrah. It's not only soft and semisweet, it's thin in fruit, with watered down blackberry jelly flavors.
80
280
This suffers from major problems. It has all the faults of a hot Zinfandel: semisweet baked-fruit flavors, a lack of acidity, and a resulting medicinal quality.
80
281
A blend of Petite Sirah and Petit Verdot, this is a clumsy wine. It's soft and overripe, and the oaky overlay doesn't do anything to improve the situation.
80
282
Way too much banana, mango and sugar. Not a prime-time player.
80
283
This isn’t a rosé; it’s much too dark for that, as deeply colored as Pinot Noir. Oddly, there’s not much fruit in either the aroma or the flavor; it’s more of an earthy, watery quality. If you try, you can imagine strawberries, but it’s a stretch. This odd wine is very dry and has some decent acidity.
80
284
If you are allergic to sulfites or insist on certified organic wines, this one fits the bill. Unfortunately it's heavy on the grape-juice characteristic, with sharp acids running the show. Dense and chewy, and there's an odd grapefruit note at the end.
80
285
Way too high in alcohol, giving it the ripe, hot, raisiny taste of a simple Port.
80
286
This is herbal, burnt and stalky smelling, then raw and herbal tasting, with weedy notes and a scratchy finish.
80
287
Made from partially fermented grape must, this sweet (slightly effervescent) ruby red wine would pair with spongecake or strawberry shortcake. The mouthfeel is watery and thin.
80
288
Nearly undrinkable for its arch-acidity that's almost still fermenting. The flavors are thin, with barely ripe blackberries and oak-like smokiness.
80
289
Tasted in early February, this Chardonnay had some secondary fermentation in the bottle, giving it a bubbly feeling. This major flaw may disappear in time.
80
290
Peju's Sauvignon Blancs need warm vintages to succeed, and 2011 was anything but warm. The wine tastes unripe, with skunky aromas and flavors that make it difficult to like.
80
291
This is acidic and sweet, with a medicinal taste.
80
292
This is oily and strained on the nose and fleshy in the mouth. It tastes herbal and quasi weedy, with a matchstick note on the finish.
80
293
This tastes barely ripe, with a vegetal flavor compromsing the chocolate and cherry notes. It's soft, making it fall a little flat in the mouth.
80
294
This is a light, fruity and off-dry wine. It has splashes of lemon and sweet citrus, with a crisp finish.
80
295
Feral, feline, sweaty aromas precede an awkward palate with bitter flavors of weedy berry, citrus fruits and pyrazines. A scallion-like quality drives the finish on this strange, bitter rosé.
80
296
Right away this goes wrong; the nose is smothered with charred, burning oak that smells harsh and like chemicals. A tannic, resiny palate is barely acceptable, as are bitter, burnt, resiny blackberry flavors.
80
297
This wine has a rustic, unclean quality. At a high alcohol level it also tastes disjointed, all about heat without fruit.
80
298
This is fleshy and dilute up front, then heavy and globular in feel. Pickled melon and vegetal stone-fruit flavors finish weak.
80
299
This smells forced and grapy, with murky undertones. Flabby on the palate, this organic red tastes nutty and earthy. An aftertaste of mulch and peanut is off base and highly questionable.
80
300
These vineyards seem to have been selected for unripe, vegetal grapes. Just manages to scrape by with a veneer of cherries.
80
301
A soft, gluey Pinot Noir, with almost no structure and bizarre cherry candy and medicinal flavors.
80
302
Low in price, high in quantity, low in quality. Dry and tannic with an off taste, the wine doesn't get better with time.
80
303
Rubbery on the nose, then sharp in the mouth, with herbal, sour plum flavors and weird funk as well. Bitter, tart and hard on the finish.
80
304
Not sure what's going on here but both bottles of this Cab smelled of diesel gasoline, burnt rubber and corn nuts.
80
305
A weird wine with a distinct and overriding clove character that's manifested on the nose, palate and finish. One-dimensional and strange, with way too much clove impact.
80
306
Sweet red fruit aromas have a chemical artificiality to them. The palate is underdeveloped, thin and tastes medicinal. Drying and hollow on the finish.
80
307
Heavy, raisiny aromas open this stewed, overweight red with sticky flavors of prune and overbaked berry. A gummy finish shows no agility.
80
308
Flat on the nose, then almost identical on the palate, this blend of Malbec, Syrah and Bonarda tastes grassy, lightly green and weedy. Cherry and berry flavors are weak. Tasted twice with similar results.
80
309
Rusty in color, this is gritty, murky and stewy on the nose. Stewy, mulchy, sweet berry flavors finish bitter and leafy.
80
310
Sawdust characterizes the nose of this strained rosé. The palate is heavy, resiny and low on acidity, while flavors of forced wood and cream are devoid of fruit.
80
311
Murky and dark in appearance, this older Bonarda smells soupy and too much like clove. Tannic and pounding, this is a stewy wine with an abundance of oak-driven clove flavor. There's sticky residue on the finish.
80
312
This is not fresh or fruity; in fact, the nose is nutty and muddied, with a rough, angular mouthfeel and flavors of peanut, vanilla and leathery raspberry.
80
313
This has already past its sell-by date. The color is tan and maderized, while the nose is soft and mushy, with raisiny aromas. Like the nose, this is flabby and past its prime in the mouth, with a bland, bitter finish.
80
314
This wine is not impressive in any way. It's tannic, abrasive and tastes stalky and weedy. The finish is rough and green, like rocks in the mouth.
80
315
Rusty in color, with aromas of compost and rotten leaves, this isn't cutting it. A drawing hard palate and burnt-out flavors that match the nose make this a hard road to navigate.
80
316
Other than a strange note of mustard, there's little to say about the nose of this brut nature Cab Franc. It tastes of sauerkraut and mustard, while the finish tastes pickled, with an infusion of vinegar.
80
317
This no-oak Petit Verdot is rusty and turning vegetal and herbal, with tomato-based flavors and a burnt-out finish.
80
318
This smells cheap, weird and almost dirty. The palate is cloying and the flavors are candied and melony, but also bitter and oxidized.
80
319
This spritzy, weird wine opens with grassy aromas that are backed by a coarse, bubbly palate with flavors of banana, lettuce and bitter greens.
80
320
Harsh, sweet and sour, this has a gluey texture that frames the cherry cough-medicine flavors.
80
321
This is saturated, flat and flabby on the nose, with pudgy blackberry aromas. It has a static, jammy mouthfeel, tasting overspiced and heavily oaked.
80
322
This blend of 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 45% Merlot and 10% Syrah was too sweet for this taster. It's full of huge ripe fruit and a lingering aroma of burnt toast.
80
323
Like a sugary punch drink, with raspberry, cherry, brandy and spice flavors.
80
324
Soft and melted, with sugary sweet berry jam flavors side by side with green mint. Unbalanced, but drinkable.
80
325
Fat, simple wine that offers ripe apples, but misses out on acidity. The finish has a candied character.
80
326
Deeply colored and pretty full-bodied, this Rhône blend has off-flavors that are medicinal and vegetative. It's just barely drinkable.
80
327
Tart and semi-ripe, this blackberry and cherry-flavored has a sweet-and-sour taste.
80
328
Sugary and Porty. Okay in a pinch when you need something red and rustic.
80
329
Overripe, with Porty flavors that have a raisin skin bitterness alongside chocolate and sweet oak.
80
330
A serviceable fizz but with off-beat aromas of beer nuts and pie crust. Foamy in the mouth, it ends with a quick orange note.
80
331
Almost equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this wine is reduced and tastes somewhat burnt, lacking in fruit with a sour aftertaste.
80
332
A grippy Cabernet lacking in fruit and personality.
80
333
A shimmering purple color is the greeting on this strange-smelling blend of Cabernet and Carmenère. The palate is weak in feel, while flavors of oaky blueberry are weird and seem manipulated.
80
334
Waxy, stalky aromas provide little to no varietal familiarity. This is acid-driven, with lemon and underripe pineapple flavors along with wheaty, stalky aftershocks. The fresh and tangy feel turns bitter on the finish.
80
335
Vanilla cookies and sulfuric match stick are about all you can draw from the bouquet. This is flat in feel, with candied, flabby flavors of green fruits. The finish is bland.
80
336
Made by a Nevada-based producer, this rosé from California-grown Grenache is very dark, exuding aromas of grenadine syrup and does follow through on the theme of sweet and viscous on the palate.
80
337
This reedy smelling, jammy boxed wine is on the cusp of acceptability. It's gooey in feel, a bit fake and sugary in flavor, and sticky on the finish.
80
338
Harsh texture, sharp acidity and green tannins. Won't age.
80
339
Dull and uninteresting, with some simple apricot flavors and unripe vegetal notes. Acceptable for its dryness and crispness, period.
80
340
Soft, sweet and syrupy, a simple wine with sugared raspberry flavors. But it's clean and drinkable.
80
341
Just barely drinkable, with sweet and sour raspberry fruit sauce flavors.
80
342
An undeniable raisiny nose leads to a soupy, flat, raisiny wine that's flawed and barely drinkable.
80
343
Aromas suggest compost, murky grit and olive. In the mouth, this wine is heavy and flat. Roasted, underripe berry-fruit flavors finish hot and gritty.
80
344
Strained from front to back. The nose smells pickled and funky, while the palate is boring in feel and tastes candied but also a lot like brine or caper juice. Sweet on the finish.
80
345
There's little going on aromatically or texturally in this thin, fairly nondescript wine.
80
346
Sweet with a burnt aftertaste, this wine cannot be highly recommended.
80
347
There's a strong scent of petroleum and burnt rubber in this wine, making it challenging to enjoy.
80
348
This Sierra Foothills producer offers an estate-bottled and produced Zin with 15% Petite Sirah that's wanting in fruit and texture. A bit thin, there's not much in the way of aromatics or texture to hold on to.
80
349
This sweet Moscato is barely acceptable and it smells strange. Creamy notes of vanilla and lychee finish bitter.
80
350
Containing all red Bordeaux varieties except Malbec, this wine has a sweet vanilla-caramel character that devolves into baked prunes.
80
351
Aromas of geraniums, celery and grassy fruits lead the nose, while flavors of green, soupy red berries finish stemmy.
80
352
From Spain's broiling Extremadura region, this Merlot-based rosé has a funky nose and mushy, leafy flavors. The finish lacks zest.
80
353
Decent in initial mouthfeel, things quickly turn hot and fiery, while the finish simmers with weedy, peppery flavors.
80
354
Dusty, yeasty aromas are faint. This feels flat on the palate, with a mix of weedy citrus flavors. Green, herbal notes carry the finish. Tasted twice.
80
355
Excessive sweetness mars this wine, making the blackberry flavors dull.
80
356
There's a strong peach-fuzz aroma enveloping this wine. It's unoaked, tasting overly rich and oily.
80
357
This smells shrill, like rhubarb and cranberry, but it's also a tad weedy. It tastes of grapefruit rather than berry fruit.
80
358
This wine has very little going on aromatically and tastes slightly burnt.
80
359
The nose is grassy and minty up front. Syrupy in feel, the palate bears a heavy green note and a tinge of raisin.
80
360
Soapy, floral aromas are more like those of a scented candle than most Malbecs. Next is an astringent, raw palate with sketchy plum flavors and bitterness to the finish. This doesn't taste convincingly natural.
80
361
Oily citrus, apple and mealy grapefruit are not particularly pleasant aromas. This is heavy and sticky, with overweight citrus and mango flavors. A melony, sulfuric finish brings the close.
80
362
This smells distinctly of rubber and little else. Unbalanced and flat in feel, with fleshy citrus and cranberry flavors, this gives off a skins-like sensation as it finishes.
80
363
Smells a lot like compost and green herbs. The palate is bitter, hard and stalky, with grassy flavors and a weedy finish. Tastes burnt out, like old coffee grinds and marginal berry fruit.
80
364
This is minty green up front, with a dilute cherry aroma. It feels hollow with green flavors that override mild red-fruit notes. Herbal on the finish.
80
365
Berry and plum aromas come with hints of smoke and asphalt. The very high acidity creates a shearing mouthfeel, and the flavors never evolve past tart red plum and cranberry.
80
366
Cherry and plum aromas lead to a choppy, rubbery-feeling palate. It tastes soupy, herbal and briney.
80
367
This smells like citrus and rhubarb more than Malbec, with a tart, herbal palate that's high in acid and short on enjoyability.
80
368
This is on its last legs. It smells maderized, flat and candied, then feels heavy and drying. It tastes and smells old, finishing bitter.
80
369
This Chardonnay has dilute peach, citrus and vegetal flavors.
80
370
Baked-apple aromas are not in accordance with an acidic palate that's stalky yet oxidized in flavor. Acidity gives the finish lift, but the balance and flavor profile are subpar.
80
371
Nobody ever said Argentina was Pinot Grigio country. This wine is yellow in color, with aromas of haystack and wheat. There's acidity to keep it upright, but flavors of briny citrus do little to bring it around.
80
372
There's little going on in this wine beyond sugary sweetness and high alcohol. There's a hint of chocolate and blackberry.
80
373
This Chard is gold in color, with mushy, oxidized aromas of honeyed peach and apple. The palate feels flabby while flavors of vanilla follow on the finish.
80
374
Cloudy to the eye, with strained aromas of sauerkraut and barnyard animal. Feels heavy and tastes rustic, with burnt, stalky, anonymous flavors. Shows bitterness and stalky flavors on the finish.
80
375
Oxidized aromas are not inviting. After the doughy, yeasty opening, the palate deals oxidized flavors of bitter and sweet red plum. Bitter on the finish; barely worth a look.
80
376
Less adequate than in the past. The wine lacks aromatic zest and pungency before showing tart apple and ultimately vegetal flavors. Canned pea notes are prevalent.
80
377
A cat-pee, grassy Sauvignon Blanc that's a little long in the tooth.
80
378
Earthy and rustic, this Pinot Noir is lightweight, with a hint of red cherry. There is an unpleasant bitter aftertaste.
80
379
Maybe southern Oregon is too hot for white wines; at least it appears to be based on this flat, rather lifeless offering. The nose is like applesauce, while the palate is bland and lazy, with only a modicum of grapefruit working in its favor. A little banana and citrus pith on the finish save it from a worse fate.
80
380
Cheese, milkweed and straw make for an unattractive nose, while the mouth is overtly sweet as if made from dried and candied mango and pineapple. The finish fades fast while leaving behind a residue left that isn't that pleasant.
80
381
The “Reserve” on the label is hardly appropriate in this banal version of what is normally a racy varietal. This version shows a mild fruit in a somewhat stewed version.
80
382
Loud citrus and berry aromas precede an overloaded palate that carries stalky plum flavors. Pickled tasting on the finish.
80
383
Slightly sweet on the nose, but wheaty and grassy too. It tastes like clay and bubble gum, with a touch of peach and citrus. It's acidic on the finish.
80
384
Strawberry and raspberry aromas set up a reedy, flush palate with stemmy, candied strawberry flavors. Turns green and bitter on the finish.
80
385
While this smells floral and candied, the palate rages, courtesy of strapping acidity that creates tart plum and blueberry flavors.
80
386
Salmon in color, this is pulpy and perfumed on the nose, with an artificial leaning. Overly foamy on the palate, this has a bitter, herbal flavor.
80
387
Disappointing considering the source. The nose reeks of chocolate mint, marshmallow and burnt leaves, while the palate is tannic, sour and shows only citrusy red fruit notes. One of Lurton's weakest wines to date.
80
388
Severely compromised by green, minty, weedy aromas and flavors. If it weren't for the color and reasonably solid mouthfeel, this would be sunk. As is, it's not a ripe, balanced wine.
80
389
A hot, harsh and unbalance Chardonnay. Barely drinkable, except for some citrus and pear flavors.
80
390
Simple but refreshing and crisp, with nice grapefruit, lime and lemon peel accents. The faintly off-dry finish turns a bit tart.
80
391
This Chardonnay-Viognier blend is slightly sweet, with vegetable-infused pineapple flavors.
80
392
While there's some nice, honest fruit here, it's weighed down by heavy vanilla overtones. The finish is long enough but shows a confected element and winds up with a singed wood tone.
80
393
Banana, clove and orange peel open for this sweet, slightly dilute white. Short finish of spring flowers.
80
394
Short and slightly sweet, there's nutty overtones, a creamy texture and good acidity but a buttery note overwhelms the fruit. Drink up.
80
395
Smells like crushed vitamins, iron and minerals, but no fruit. Weak, funky and sour tasting, and then angular on the finish. There's even some sauerkraut in the mix. Not what we're looking for.
